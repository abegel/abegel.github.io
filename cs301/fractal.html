<UL>
			<LI>Fractals, like recursive procedures are defined in terms of themselves. 
			<li>Any part is similar to the whole

			<LI>The phrase &quot;Fractals&quot; was coined by Benoit Mandelbrot

			<LI>They describe naturally-occurring phenomena, e.g., the path of a meandering river, a coastline, a fern leaf, snowflakes, or the explosion of a pyramid scheme.  <UL>
				
			</UL>
  <LI>We look at fractal definitions just like we look at recursive
  function definitions:
  <UL>
    <LI>Base case
    <LI>Recursive case

			<LI>Logo Turtle
			<ul>
				<li>A creature that moves around on a grid
				<ul>
					<li>Center is (0, 0)
					<li>X increases to the right
					<li>Y&nbsp;increases up
				</ul>
				<li>Has built-in state:
				<ul>
					<li>xcor: x-coordinate (a real number)
					<li>ycor: y-coordinate (a real number)
					<li>heading: the turtle's current direction (a real number from 0-359.9999999)
					<li>pen state: a turtle carries a pen which can be dragged behind to draw on the grid
					<li>color: the color of the turtle's pen
				</ul>
			</ul>
			<li>You can teach it to do new tricks by defining a procedure

  <LI>Let's look at the code which does this.

<H3><A NAME="sierpinskitriangle"></A>Your Second Fractal : Sierpinski
triangle</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Similar to the square, but a little more complicated due
  to geometry
  <LI>Start with a triangle and remove the inner inverted triangle.
  <LI>Base case: equilateral triangle
  <LI>Recursive case: A sierpinski triangle is three smaller (by
  1/2) sierpinski triangles placed in the three corners of the
  original triangle

<H3><A NAME="tree"></A>Binary Tree : &quot;And they tell two friends,
and they tell two friends...&quot;</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Want to see explosive growth of exponentials
  <LI>A binary tree is a fork up top and two binary trees on each
  arm

<H3><A NAME="peano"></A>Peano Curve : Space-filling!</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>As <TT>n</TT> approaches infinity, completely fills space!
  <LI>A peano curve is a path. If the distance from the start to
  the finish is 3x, the peano curve is drawn as follows
  <UL>
    <LI>Start at the start.
    <LI>Go 2x of the way toward the destination. (E)
    <LI>Make a left turn, go x (N)

variants!</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Start with a straight line.
  <LI>Find a point which makes an isosceles right triangle
  <LI>Draw a recursive version between the beginning point and
  the new point, there are now two options:
  <LI>C-curve
  <UL>
    <LI>Draw a recursive version between the new point and the end
    point

  <UL>
    <LI>Draw a recursive version between the end point and the new
    point
  </UL>
  <LI>Dragon is space-filling!

<H3><A NAME="koch"></A>Koch Curves : Snowflakes and Anti-snowflakes</H3>

<UL>
  <LI>Start with an equilateral triangle.
  <LI>Divide each side into thirds, delete the middle third, and
  construct a point off that length from the deleted side that
  forms a smaller equilateral triangle.
  <LI>The anti-snowflake just means we push the point <B>inside</B>
  rather than <B>outside</B>.

  <LI>We saw six examples of fractals; what a wonderful, beautiful
  world is mathematics!

<UL>
  <LI>We look at graphics with some randomness, Fibonacci, Tower
  of Hanoi, and maybe some game theory!

  moves possible

  <LI>You may never place a disk on top of a smaller one

<H2><A NAME="game"></A>Game : Brussels Sprouts</H2>

<UL>
  <LI>This is a game invented by John Conway and Michael Paterson
  and played with a pencil and paper.
  <LI>You start wtih a number of 4-arm crosses.
  <LI>A move is to connect two arms (of the same cross or of two
  different ones) and to make a new cross by drawing a crossbar
  somewhere along the line, as below:

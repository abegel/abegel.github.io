<title>A TA on TAing</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor = "FFFFFF">

<p>This little page is a background document for a talk in CS 301 or "How to
TA" for first-time TAs in Computer Science. I was a TA for CS61a in
Fall 1997 and I had a blast. Hopefully, this page will help you see
some of the things that I learned during that term and during
subsequent education classes.</p>

<h1>Interacting with Your Students</h1>

<p>Nobody can stress this enough. Essentially, your entire existence as a 
TA is defined by your relationship with your students ('scuse me for
messing up the reflexive tense here. I'm in CS not English). If you
don't love them, they won't love you back. If you don't respect them,
they won't respect you back. If you don't give them milk and cookies
at every section... well, that's bribery. I don't recommend it. Get
your kiddies to like you for your teaching and your personality, not
your gifts.</p>

<p>Anyway, this part of the talk is about various ways you interact with
your students. The predominant one that gets all the attention is the
weekly section.</p>

<h2>Preparing for Section</h2>

<p>When do you prepare for section? If you're like me, you do it the
night before. Maybe even think about it during the day before if
you're ambitious. Only a person like Dan Garcia will prepare for a
week ahead. Well, almost only. When you're TAing and you like what
you're doing, you think of cool ideas for section <i>all</i> the
time. </p>

<p>What resources do you have to prepare from?</p>

<dl>
  <li>old classes that you took
  <li>other TAs
  <li>book
  <li>badly done things in lecture
  <li>email questions from students
  <li>office hours questions
  <li>old tests
  <li>test results
</dl>

<p>I took 6.001 at MIT of which CS61a is a version (note the correct use
of the clause without the dangling "of"). Bonus! I've got all
these great handouts and quiz reviews and problems all set up.</p>

Of course, they're not quite right for the class, and they're in the
wrong order and maybe some of them were loser questions... what's a TA 
to do?

<p>Practice, practice, practice and organize (PPPO. P3O. See
P3O. sigh... It's like Star Wars, only sadder).</p>

<p>How much of an outline do you prepare?  Do you stick to it in
section? I prepared a few different questions, put them in order, then
added a few more (because, god forbid, you're standing up in front of
the class saying things like "Got any questions? About anything?
Bueller? Anyone alive? Hello.. hello.. hello.. echo.. echo.. echo...").</p>

<p>Another big one: come with props (no, not kind words for your
homeboy). Props like handouts (Dan loves these). Props like extra help 
assignments, or quiz review questions, or just questions that might
get your students to think. </p>
 
<p>Do you practice (Do you watch The Practice? Great show about
lawyers and morality)? In front of a mirror? In front of your
roommate? Naked in front of your roommate? Or a mirror? Naked in front 
of your roommate, a mirror and a package of string? Do you practice at 
all? Like I always say Practice, Practice, Practice,
Organize. PPPO. P3O. 3 times P + O. 3PO. See 3PO. R2D2 (bet you
thought I'd say C3PO. Well, a guy has to have his surprises now and again).</p>

<p>Anyway, onto what actually happens in section.</p>

<h2>Running the Section</h2>

<p>Running a section is often like running a show on PBS. You gotta
combine entertainment with education so that the students either don't 
realize all the neat stuff they're learning (wrong), or the students
love what they're learning so much that they ask for more ("may I have 
another cons cell, sir?"). </p>

<p>When I start section, I do like the Playbill in a theatre show. I
put up a list of Acts and what topics are discussed inside. </p>

<dl>
  <li>Introduction: Reminders about homework, tests, rent checks.
  <li>First Act: Recursion.
  <li>Intermission: Stupid Scheme Tricks. 
  <li>Entracte: Administrivia,
  <li>Second Act: Append and his Sorting Friends.
  <li>Finale: Neato-rific Super-duper Wrapup.
</dl>

<p>What are good wake-up calls to your snoozing students? Face it, no
matter how interesting you might be, if the seats are comfortable and
they are undergraduates, they're going to fall asleep at least once
during a one and a half hour section. </p>

<p>If you notice, there's that funny thing in the middle. Dave
Patterson does this. Well, he just does administration. I do funny
stuff with Scheme. Because Scheme is cool. And I think the students
deserve to understand <b>exactly</b> how cool it is by solving the
stupid scheme trick of the day. It's usually some incredibly
complicated Scheme program that when elucidated actually turns out to
do something trivial. But it's fun to figure out and that's why I like 
it (Try this in C and see how far you get. Total confusion within
<font size =+2>seconds!</font>). </p>

<p>We pause for two TAs in the class to give us an idea of what their
teaching style is like. Stand up and go through the first five minutes 
of your last section.</p>

<p>Ok, now let's critique it.</p>

<dl>
  <li>What did the TA say?
  <li>did they jump right in or ease in?
  <li>how much information did they get across?
  <li>how much did they talk vs. how much did students talk?
  <li>who wasn't paying attention?
  <li>did the TA notice?
</dl>
 
<p>Another really important item to notice when you're TAing for real is
whether or not your students understand a thing you say. What if only
the first few smart people in the front of the class get it? Do you
continue? How do you know when to just move on or when to repeat
something in a new way?</p>

<p><font size=+10>Listen!</font></p> 

<p>I think the key to being a good TA is to shut up as much as
possible. No, don't let dead air rule the roost, but make your
students talk. Hey, if they're talking they can't sleep on you. And if 
they're talking, it might even mean that they're thinking. About
schoolwork. And your class. And maybe even about the topic at
hand.</p>

<p>Don't be cruel and call on people you know aren't listening. That's 
just mean. But, a nice trick is to learn everyone's name in the class
and use them in your examples. Not only will they perk up at the
mention of their own name, but if you put them in a linked list with
their project partners, you can get them to like each other. Well, at
least on the wipeboard.</p>

<h2>Non-traditional Sections</h2>

<p>Do you always have to work on school work during section? Is the
pope Catholic? Does a bear shit in the woods? Does Microsoft eat up
<i>every</i> company that gets in its way? No! And that's why your
creativity can spice up a boring section.</p>

<p>I came from MIT. So I taught my students the MIT cheer (not that we 
have school spirit at MIT, but it's geek humor, and that's what
counts). </p>

<b><p>E to the U, dU, dx. E to the x, dx.<br>
Cosine, secant, tangent, sine.<br>
Three point one four one five nine.<br>
Integral, radical, mu dV.<br>
Slipstick, slide rule, M-I-T!</p></b>

<p><font size = -1>(I told you it was geeky)</font></p>

<p>I've got geek poetry too. But the best game we played was Human
Cons Cell Jeopardy.</p>

<p>Form students into teams of four students each. Pick a team at
random to come up to the front of the class. Give them a sheet a paper 
with a box-and-pointer diagram with four cons cells on it. Each
student plays a cons cell. Their left arm is "car" and their right arm 
is "cdr". Tell them to arrange themselves in the structure shown and
point to the start of the structure with your left hand.</p>

<p>Students in the other teams have to not only guess what Scheme
structure is being displayed, but also write Scheme code to create
it. When they have it, they buzz in and write it up on the board. If
they're right, they get a big smile and the pride in knowing how to
write Scheme.</p>

<p>Play gets hard when you have recursive structures. See if you can
make a structure that contains no primitive types! You might call this 
game Human Cons Cell Twister because sometimes the teams get a bit too 
wrapped up in this and fall down (It's hilarious, trust me).</p>

<p>So where else do you see your students?</p>

<h2>Office Hours</h2>

<p>Office hours are pure face time. You, a student, one on one. Whoops
another student just walked in. You, two students, one on two. Shit,
another three walked in. You, five stud--- argh! Three more! Ok, so
it's not the most ideal one-on-one situation.</p>

<p>What exactly do you cover in office hours? Well, here's the place
to answer individual questions. There are four types of students here:

<ul> 
  <li>The Smart Student: He's just trying to get on your good side and 
hang out with you. Don't worry about ulterior motives. Hang out. Have
fun.
  <li>The Contrary Student: This student doesn't care about what's
being taught, but just expects you to give him a brain dump of all of
the material. Since that's just not gonna happen, try to force him to
ask the questions and lead him socratic-like to the answer.
  <li>The Simple Student: This student really wants to learn, but just 
finds everything hard. His questions may seem stupid, but there's some 
inkling of a logic process in there. If you keep trying, he'll get it.
  <li>The Student Who Doesn't Even Know How to Ask a Question: This
student is so far behind in the course, that it's probably wise to ask 
questions about whether or not there's something better they might be
doing with their time. If you have the time, and they're only behind
in one or two areas, start from basics and run through a mini-section
with them as your only pupil. Make sure not to lecture to them, but
get them involved to do most of the work. Once they gain confidence,
they'll be able to pick up some of it on their own.
</ul>

<p>How long are your office hours? I had two per week, one hour
each. I had scheduled them at a particular time, but the students
couldn't make it. I negotiated with them until we picked a time that
was great for them and good enough for me.</p>

<p>Can you scale to 10 students? How do you deal with a few without
ignoring the others? When I did this, it tended to turn into a
mini-section. It turned out that when one person had a question, the
others realized that they wanted to learn about that subject too. But
do take advantage of the fact that you're in a small setting. Make
them do all the work. Just sit back and nod approvingly every so often 
and guide them toward the answer.</p>

<p>What do you do right before a test? Usually, you play 1/4 catchup
review artist and 3/4 psychotherapist. Calm them down, reassure them
that they know the material and reinforce a few gotchas you think they 
might miss.</p>

<h2>Email</h2>

<p>How many emails do you get from your students? Do you write to
them? In my CS61a folder there are 978 messages. That's 300 per month,
75 per week, and 15 per day.</p>

<p>Woo! It seems like it should take all my time but it doesn't. It's
fun to answer their questions. Especially since you don't have to get
back to them right that second. It's ok to take an hour or two
off. Don't stretch that to more than a day, however, or they'll stop
writing you because you're unresponsive. Some of my best section
topics came from student emails.</p>
   



<h1>Time Management</h1>

<p>How much time do you spend preparing for section? Office hours?
Responding to email? Is there any time left for your own classes or
research?</p>

<p><font size =+2>TAing expands to fill your time.</font></p>

<p>Any time left over is for classes and research. But don't expect to 
get much done. Well, unless you hate TAing and never spend any time on 
it. But I loved it. More than my research at the time, and for sure
more than my classes. </p>

<p>You just have to have a good work ethic. Always work on
TAing. Always work on your classes. Slack off on research. Usually
that's supposed to take a while anyway, so no one will notice. Take
some weekends off. Not before a test. But some. See some friends. Tell 
them <b>all</b> about your students. Don't worry. You aren't boring
them to death. Really.</p>

<h1>Reflection on Your Own Teaching</h1>

<p>Do you like TAing? Which parts? Why? Have you ever told your
students this (you should probably call your mother, too. It's been a
while, hasn't it?)? </p>

<p>What parts do you hate? Do you gripe about TAing to your friends?
to your students? to the prof? Do you mean it?</p>
   
<p>How has your teaching changed over time? For me, I was scared in
the beginning because I didn't know what to do if the students asked
me a question I couldn't answer. Over time, I became more confident
due to two things. One, 61a is relatively easy material and it's not
hard to master it all. Two, 61a students don't know much about
anything in CS yet, so any question they ask is usually easy enough
that you can figure out the answer in the time that it takes them to
breathe in after finishing their question (It also impresses the hell
out of them when you can answer the question without seeming to think
about it at all). </p>

<p>As the material becomes harder, you have to come up with better
explanations, and more of them. You might think one explanation is
good, but it could backfire for some students, maybe even all of
them. Having backup explanations for things marks the sign of a
well-prepared TA.</p>

<p>Over the term, I learned everyone's name. This made it much easier
to call on them and ask them to answer questions for me without
refering to "you there in the red jacket in the last row!" </p>

<p>Know your weaknesses! I don't have enough practice explaining
really hard concepts. I tend to jump to first principles and work my
way up to the concept. Unfortunately, this takes time. So if there are 
two hard concepts to explain I don't get to the second. What to do? At 
the very least, I write the class email explaining the second topic so 
they at least get the information in a timely manner.</p>

<p>If I haven't worked out a topic fully before I explain it, I find
it really easy (and tempting) to go off on a tangent and descend into
madness. Prompted by a student, I accidentally tried to explain the Y
combinator. Not a good idea. After 10 minutes, I stopped, said I was
not going to go on and backed up to a better topic. The students were
very relieved. Of course, after that section, I apologized to the
students over email, and explained the topic fully there for those
that cared. And, definitely told them the material was <i>not</i> on
the test. :)</p>  

<h1>Conclusion</h1>

<p>So these are just a few of those things that a TA should keep in
mind. Hopefully, you've learned something from this. If you disagree
with me or agree with me or anything in between, and want to let me
know about it, you can write to me at <a href =
"mailto:abegel@cs.berkeley.edu">abegel@cs.berkeley.edu</a>. I'm all
ears!</p>

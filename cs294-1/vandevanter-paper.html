<p class=MsoNormal><span style='mso-tab-count:1'>            </span>In this
paper, Michael Van De Vanter writes about the lessons he learned while working
on the Pan project at Berkeley. He frames the discussion as a series of
requirements for language-aware programming editors that, in taking a
user-cented viewpoint instead of a technology-driven viewpoint, can actually
help a programmer better understand his code. Some lessons learned: structured
editors that impose structure on the user tend to degrade badly in the face of
errors and incomplete programs. The artifacts built before Pan apparently were
well-studied, but often found of dubious value for anyone with skills beyond
that of the novice. As well, these tools tended to be language-specific, making
technology and UI reuse impossible across languages. Pan, a
language-independent program editor used structure behind the scenes to run
analyses that could be presented to the user to improve their understanding of
their program. Pan intended to create a more open architecture (or at least
Ensemble and Harmonia have) to enable external tools to have access to the
structures inside. Harmonia succeeds pretty well, in this regard, having been
hooked up to Xemacs for its editor and to BANE for semantic analysis using
constraints. The UI research, while important in the Pan research prototype, is
less important today, as more and more modern programming environments support
the kinds of features that Pan had. However, the impact of these more modern
features (such as class hierarchy views, showing compile errors at edit-time,
hyperlinks between variables and methods, uses and defs, code style
enforcement, code style help (a la enabling Hungarian notation transparently))
have not yet been fully tested to evaluate their impact on the population of
programmers. Like compiler analyses that only enable a 0.005% improvement in
code running time, I would imagine that many of the ideas here could fall in
the same boat w.r.t. programmer usability and effectiveness. It needs to be
tested more. </p>

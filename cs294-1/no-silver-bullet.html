If we’re lucky, the growth will be linear, but history tells usthat it’s probably nonlinear. </p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Half of this paper speaks to the inherent complexityand changeability of the design of software, whereas the rest makes theargument that the implementation and testing process is no more than a fractionof the time. Various mechanisms such as OOP, high-level languages, graphicalprogramming, design patterns and static analysis have been developed to improveand augment the human ability to create code and minimize bugs. And for the mostpart, they do work. Due to this, the programmer workforce has becomeincreasingly commoditized -- all programmers’ skill sets change over time astheir tools and computers change, leaving the only main differences to innateintelligence, common sense and motivation. </p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>My friend David thinks that while it may bepossible to write a book explaining everything one needs to write good code,you couldn’t write one to say how to design a system. Our current educationsystem tries to address design by example, by a form of apprenticeship. Oneoften hears, I know a good design when I see it. There may be principles todesign in a particular domain, but these techniques often don’t translate toother domains, in the same way that math transcends physics and mechanicalengineering. Designing software is a creative process, as Brooks says. Andcombined with the conclusion above that the software engineer’s innateabilities most influence their final product, great designs only come fromgreat software designers. </p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Now, let’s take a step back. Brooks suggestsoutsourcing and software reuse as potential ways for a company to get aroundimproving its software designers’ productivity. In essence, these tools wouldmake the problem smaller, enabling the company to be more nimble withoutactually resolving problems that others have already solved. <spanstyle="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>However, real reuse is still a pipedream, and using off the shelf software requires an investment in learning thesystem (and since documentation of software, especially APIs is still so bad,this learning process takes a long time). </p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Brooks should have mentioned how designerspecialization could help improve design times. If worker specialization helpedon the assembly line, it may help in software design. Perhaps, also, the numberof problems to be solved will stop increasing as quickly, and only in nichemarkets will bigger and bigger problems be found (I don’t believe this, but myfriend Eytan does). A final point that Brooks does not address is thereeducation of the workforce. While it is possible to learn new languages andnew design techniques and new skills over time, is our computer scienceeducational process really giving developers the tools they need to speed uptheir own learning process, or is this something that we just leave to theindividual and hope for the best?</p></div></body></html>

From my original perspective as an academic who wascontinually frustrated with publicly available tools (read GNU) and admiredvendor-provided tools as much higher quality but much higher cost, to say thatI’m experiencing a complete revision of historical perspective is saying itgently. All the development processes I had taken for granted: open sourcecode, open CVS repositories, an amorphous set of developers, an amorphous setof kvetchers, a set of mailing lists to keep track of development, bugs and useof the software, code that is not tightly held by a small group of designers –seem to be invented notions proffered by Stallman, McKusik, Raymond assolutions to their perception of software development at the time:non-accessible source code, tightly held design, hidden design criteria andtest suites, poor quality software, a fixed set of paid developers loyal to thecompany, bug mailing lists that might as well be /dev/null, and unresponsive companymanagement. Wow! </p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>If we accept the open-source ideals as gospel,what implications ought it have for software development? First, they don’tclaim this will work for all software. Specifically, Raymond suggests there hasto be a kernel of code that already works and people are interested in that wasdeveloped in a small team privately and then released to the world. Once thatcode builds up a critical mass of users (and detractors), open-sourcing it justtaps into the growing demand for changes that are beyond the means of theoriginal developers. Second, if a project is open-source, wouldn’t that meanthat no one could make any money from it? Well, here’s the neat thing.According to Tiemann, of Cygnus Solutions, that’s not true. Since most clientsof open-source code would have been clients of the equivalent vendor-providedbinaries, these same clients are completely willing to pay money for theirsoftware, because they perceive the software to provide them some benefitwithout having to waste their own engineers on it. This means that if there’s acompany out there that is claiming credit for large portions of the open sourcecode base for a particular project that some other company wants to use (andmost likely customize for their usage), that company is likely to be found andpaid by potential clients. The only catch here, which is what makes thissubversive, is that all code developed by Cygnus (a prototypical example of anopen-source company) is donated, free, back to the open source for all to use.So while the work by Cygnus is paid for by clients who want more functionality,the functionality itself is free to spread. That’s just amazing. Tiemann quotesJefferson, “Information, no matter how expensive to create, can be replicatedand shared at little or no cost.” </p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>I now understand where the open-source movementis coming from, and how it can fit into the capitalist society that we’ve got,but where does it need to go? It relies heavily on volunteerism, people whohave free time and feel like contributing. In this sense, it’s no differentfrom a temple activity group, or the Lions club, only it’s for geeks. But is itreasonable to expect that there will always be a volunteer base, or will mostdevelopment have to be taken over by companies like Cygnus (now owned byRedhat)? </p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>There are other deficiencies in the open sourcemodel as well. UI design is said to not be found at all in open sourcesoftware. Linux is ugly. Gnome and KDE are poor facsimiles of Windows, which isalready considered to be a UI nightmare. Why doesn’t UI design work in an opensource world. It’s because UI design isn’t about coding; it’s not about theman-machine interface – it’s about the human-human interface. Humans need totalk to other humans and watch other humans when they use the computer in orderto gain any insight into how to improve an interface. Coders are far more comfortabletalking to computers in abstractions that are similar to the programming languagesin which they write, instead of the abstractions that non-technical people arecomfortable with. Without speaking to non-technical people about theirexperiences with computers, coders all but ignore them in the development oftheir software. <span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Finally, we list one more deficiency that isnear and dear to my heart: quality. The quality of open-source software oftenleaves a lot to be desired. The software evolves way too rapidly, often hastons of bugs in most early stages of development, and if your task is to justget your work done, and not spend your time fixing the open-source tools that youuse, you just spin your wheels, waiting for show-stopping bugs to get fixedevery other week. Personally, I’ve had it with GCC and any UNIX-compatibleshells on Windows. They just don’t work correctly for all the code and MakefilesI want to write and use. For people like me, who care more about their ownproject than the open-source tools we use, open-source will always remain afrustrated source of code that’s too complex and time-consuming to “fix” on myown, and isn’t fixed fast enough to get my work done. </p></div></body></html>

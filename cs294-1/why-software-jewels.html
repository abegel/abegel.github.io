Parnas is the more realistic one, and understands that the twinpressures laid on by marketing to add features and develop code quickly forcesengineers to cut corners. This often results in a quick, haphazard design andugly code. In addition, since all successful software is legacy software, mostfeature additions are evolved into an already existent code base, which,without the benefit of a complete redesign to properly incorporate the newfeatures, suffers further ugliness. </p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Everyone<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;</span>learns about the concept of elegance in school. But how do we teach it?It seems the most common way is by example. But often students miss thislesson. We then try actively to teach design, by introducing students to designpatterns and providing public code libraries where students can go to findprototypical solutions to small problems that they encounter in their ownprojects. In our software engineering classes, we also try to teach the mantrasof problem decomposition, hierarchy, modularity and proper interfaces. Blahblah blah. Unfortunately, mantras don’t work. Students only pay lip service tothese principles because their problems are not big enough to fail withoutunderstanding the principles. </p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Wirth seems to believe the real world is likeacademia – that you’ve got all the time in the world to develop and redevelopcode among a small stable set of developers. Personally, I like this approach.I’ve rewritten my Master’s project (a programming language implementation)around 20 times. Each time makes it much more gem-like, and I learn a littlebit more about the right techniques for the task. In general, my philosophy forwriting anything, even code involves three drafts: First draft – you don’t knowwhat you want to say and you don’t know how to say. Second draft – you knowwhat you want to say, but you don’t know how to say it. Third version – youknow what you want to say <b>and,</b><span style='font-weight:normal'> finally,you know how to say it.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>However,Parnas is more pragmatic and knows we live in the real world where design andhardware constraints combine with time constraints to make elegant, polishedsolutions impossible.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>I tangentially disagree with Wirth’s conclusionthat software today is bloated. He doesn’t ask the question about why today’ssoftware is bloated. What proportion of code is in graphics files and sounds?How about the effects of using object-oriented languages vs. procedurallanguages: Do the compilers perform as well? Is the source code just bigger? Ismaintainable code bigger/slower? Someone should take the end-user goals ofhaving a user-friendly interface, reliability and maintainability and see whateffects these have on code bloat. I view end-user goals as positive factorswhatever their effects on code. </p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>Lastly, it seems that Wirth loves theprogramming language approach to solving problems in coding; Parnas disagreesand thinks it’s all in the design, since you can write elegant code in anylanguage. I take a more balanced approach. If you mismatch your problem orengineer to the language, you’re going to get ugly code. A language enables youto think about the problem in a particular way as well as hopefully enablingyou to write a constrained program. Get the right engineer to use the rightlanguage for the task and you’ve leveled your playing field. However, languagesare not a complete panacea. Strongly-typed languages eliminate type bugs – alarge class of bugs when compared to dynamically-typed languages, but theydon’t help worth a darn to identify when the semantics of a solution are wrongor the design itself is flawed. Once again, we return to the thesis of NoSilver Bullet. There’s no easy answer to this problem that applies to allpeople and all problems </p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p></div></body></html>

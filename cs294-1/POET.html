The major point isthat all items have identifying marks that indicate how they’re to be used.These marks are called affordances. An example is a door with a flat panel onit, which indicates that you should push it there to open the door. Inaddition, for devices whose purpose is not entirely transparent, and whosefunction does not afford direct manipulation, there exists a mapping betweenform and function. In some cases, this mapping can be obvious (e.g. theMercedes seat adjuster), but in most, it’s not. Don Norman gives many cleverexamples of affordances and devices that fail to meet a user’s expectations,leading to much confusion. In that, he’s written a very well-supported articlethat is easy to understand. However, he seems unfairly biased against the kindsof mappings found in computer interfaces, or pretty much in any technology,where constraints on the physical interface trump all other constraints. Yes,the big idea in a computer is that one little square of silicon can do anythingat all – the physical container does not expose the possibilities or afford anyideas on how to use it. Perhaps in later chapters he expounds on software userinterfaces, but in this one he merely seems to dismiss non-physically-basedinterfaces as belonging to the class of hard-to-use items. </p><p class=MsoNormal><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoNormal>Contextual Design – Beer and Holtzblatt</p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]><o:p></o:p></p><p class=MsoBodyTextFirstIndent>This paper describes Contextual Design, adesign methodology for user interface designers that embeds them in the life oftheir users in the hopes that they begin to understand the user’s world, beforeallowing them to begin designing. I think James Landay uses this designmethodology in CS160. It appears that ethnographic studies of this sort arecurrently in vogue in HCI, however unlike XP in the software engineering world,these ideas actually seem to be grounded in reality. Observing your users,modeling their work flow and consolidating the ideas (into an abstraction)borrows extensively from anthropology; work redesign with a team is heavilyadapted from management principles and rhetoric and public policy, finally,user interface design and paper mockups (lo-fi prototypes) have always been astandby of traditional HCI. I agree completely with this paper, however, thereare problems with the length of time needed to perform the technique properly.An ethnographic study, while revealing to the utmost degree, is alsotime-intensive; if this is your team’s only full-time job, then that’s fine. Ifnot, you need shortcuts to get good data. Luckily, the research community hasexplored this idea (I’ve read one paper in Jen Mankoff’s Assistive Technologyclass called Rapid Ethnography: Time Deepening Strategies for HCI FieldResearch (Daniel Millen, CUU 2000)). Otherwise the field of HCI might becomeall about anthropology and no one would ever get to the good stuff on thecomputer. </p></div></body></html>

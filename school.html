					<h2>School</h2>
					<p>I work with Prof. <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~graham">Susan Graham</a> on programming languages and environments. I'm currently working on a few projects.</p>
					<ul>
						<li>My main work is to enable programmers (especially students) to use a multi-modal environment when composing (e.g. writing a design document or a program), browsing  (e.g., reading and navigating), or modifying (i.e. changing an existing document) their code, and when exploring the runtime properties of their executable (debugging and profiling). <br>
						This work will combine off-the-shelf speech recognition software (IBM&nbsp;ViaVoice) and &quot;off-the-research-shelf&quot; language analysis technology (Harmonia) and gesture recognition technology to create a software development environment that will enable students and software developers to work more efficiently, to produce better software, to mitigate some of the physical difficulties that accompany computer use, and to have a more enjoyable working environment.
						<li>In Spring '99, I worked with <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~philipb">Philip Buonadonna</a> and <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~dgay">David Gay</a> on an implementation of <a href="http://now.cs.berkeley.edu/AM/active_messages.html">Active Messages</a> over <a href="http://www.millennium.berkeley.edu/~philipb/via/">VIA</a>, and four implementations of the <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/parallel/castle/split-c/">Split-C</a> parallel programming language over VIA. We submitted a paper to ASPLOS&nbsp;2000 and are waiting to hear back.
						<li>A project I worked on in Fall '98 was <a href="cs264/index.html">NinjaScript</a>, a data-flow language for composing network services in <a href="http://ninja.cs.berkeley.edu">Ninja</a>.
						<li>Another project I&nbsp;help out with is <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/Research/Projects/titanium/">Titanium</a>, a SIMD parallel superset of Java. I've been working on thread support, synchronization, and integrating Titanium into a distributed systems framework. I'm also working on a port of Harmonia to the <a href="(Empty Reference!)">Millennium</a> PC&nbsp;cluster.
						<li>I extended the work I did with packet filters (with <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~mccanne">Steve McCanne</a>) in CS265 to BPF+, a packet filter architecture that exploits global data-flow optimizations to compile efficient filters from high-level representations. Steve, Sue and I wrote a <a href="sigcomm99/bpf+.ps">paper</a> about our work which appeared in SIGCOMM '99.

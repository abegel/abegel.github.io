Manual Disambiguation</A>
</H3>

<P>
We note that not all ambiguities can disambiguated through
analysis. What if there were both a field and a method with the same
name? What if two possibilities for token concatenation were both
equally valid (e.g. <TT>print("line")</TT> vs. <TT>printLine()</TT>)?
Capitalization affects semantics in many languages, and could have a
big impact on program structure (e.g. in Java, <TT>Class</TT> (a type)
vs. <TT>class</TT> (a keyword defining the beginning of a new class
definition)).

<P>
In addition, we believe that some ambiguities should not be resolved
automatically, even if they could. For instance, the precedence of
the <TT>else</TT> statement as part of a nested <TT>if-then-else</TT> clause
is typically resolved in the language grammar. Why? This is because
programming language grammars were required to be
unambiguous. However, this early resolution is dangerous since the
user is unaware that there might be a problem. And, if the grammar
specifies a different precedence than the one the user had in mind,
choosing the unanticipated parse tree could lead to semantic bugs in
their code. 

<P>
Since we're using a GLR parser, we preserve all parses through to the
semantic analysis phase. After we've run our disambiguation
algorithms, we will engage the software developer in a dialogue and
ask them to pick the proper parses from the ambiguities that are left
in the parse forest. The chosen resolution of each ambiguity would be
stored in the resulting parse tree and saved with the program (so that
the user will not be asked again each time the program is analyzed).

<P>
What form should this dialogue between the user and analysis system
take? Interactive techniques are able to disambiguate speech and pen
input before it arrives at the lexer&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node29.html#suhm96">50</A>], but this is
undesirable because many of the ambiguities might very well be
resolved automatically through context or semantics. Current research
by Mankoff et. al.&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node29.html#burlap">37</A>,<A
 HREF="node29.html#mankoff00-uist">36</A>] develops the
ability to pass ambiguities through the application to modular
mediators, which can provide a semantically-aware process for
ambiguity resolution. We aim to incorporate these latter ideas into
our prototype programming by voice editor. In addition, we will
provide access to the standard speech recognition tools for improving
spoken language recognition accuracy and for adding new words to the
dictionary.

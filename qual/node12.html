Semantic Ambiguities</A>
</H3>

<P>
A natural language speech recognizer uses the natural language grammar
and semantics to disambiguate homophones, parts of speech and
capitalization. Fortunately, disambiguation of programming languages
will be considerably easier than natural language because the context
provided by the program will be a rich source of disambiguating
information. 

<P>
There are two aspects to the semantic analysis of programs or similar
linguistic documents.  The first is akin to the semantic phase of a
compiler, namely, binding analysis, name resolution, type checking,
and other analyses derived from the semantic definition of the
language.  We refer to that as semantic analysis.  The second
determines properties of the particular instance, e.g. the program.
Examples of such analyses include data flow, alias analysis,
complexity measures, slicing, etc. We refer to that as program
analysis.

<P>
In the Pan system, we developed an incrementally evaluated structured
variant of logic programming to define and maintain semantic
consistency and constraints on formally specified language
documents&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node29.html#ballance_graham:91iclp">6</A>].  That was an elegant
solution, with built-in query support, but suffered from significant
performance problems.
Ensemble's implementation of semantic analysis is based on the
Colander II system&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node29.html#maddox-thesis">35</A>], which transforms an attribute
grammar-based description of the analysis into a compiled incremental
attribute evaluator that is applied to the syntax tree whenever
semantic information is requested.

<P>
Colander II has both strengths and weaknesses.  Among its strengths,
the metalanguage is very expressive, while also exposing
incrementality rather than hiding it in semantic functions.  The
evaluators handle long-distance dependencies and aggregate attributes
efficiently, and exhibit excellent overall incremental performance.
The incremental evaluation methods have more general applicability
than just for attribute grammars.  However, the formalism shares with
most attribute grammar systems&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node29.html#ag-book">15</A>] the property of being
monolithic, in the sense that all aspects of the specification
potentially interact.  That makes the avoidance of circularity
difficult, despite the more powerful mechanism we have
developed&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node29.html#maddox-thesis">35</A>], and inhibits the ability to
encapsulate ``chunks'' of functionality, such as symbol table
abstractions, for re-use in other language specifications.  For
example, the ability to specify a multi-phase analysis, instead of
having evaluation order determined by dependencies alone, would
simplify the design of the specifications and facilitate specification
re-use.

<P>
When the H-3ARMONIA framework was created, we removed Colander II
support, and only replaced it with an <I>ad hoc</I> mechanism for
semantic analysis of a parse tree that is custom-written in C<FONT SIZE="-2">++</FONT>. This
solution is inadequate for the kinds of disambiguation analysis we
will need.  As part of our research we will explore a hybrid approach
of Colander and Colander II that lets the analysis writer split the
analysis into multiple phases, with a well-defined interface. The
different analysis components can then use different algorithms, some
incremental and some not, to achieve a better balance between ease of
specification and efficient incremental evaluation. The choice of
analysis method would be tuned to such factors as the locality of
dependences or the utility of change-based information. At the coarser
grain of the interaction of analyzers, the analysis would remain
incremental.

<P>
In addition, the new analyzer must support set-based analysis of a
parse forest with the ability to prune ``incorrect'' subtrees from the
forest if found semantically inconsistent. In the natural language
community, where GLR is one of many popular parsing techniques that
produce parse forests, learning how to perform semantic disambiguation
on the compressed parse forest data structure has become an
increasingly important area of research&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node29.html#nederhof93">41</A>,<A
 HREF="node29.html#schiehlen96">49</A>,<A
 HREF="node29.html#dekkers92">14</A>,<A
 HREF="node29.html#harper94">26</A>,<A
 HREF="node29.html#visser97-disambiguation">58</A>]. Due to the much larger
ambiguities in natural language syntax, expansion of parse forests
prior to traditional semantic analysis on each parse tree would be
infeasible due to the space required. We believe that a set-based
attribute grammar would be able to operate efficiently on the parse
forests produced by H-3ARMONIA and will adapt techniques from the
natural language community for our uses. 

<P>
Finally, we require support for semantic queries in the H-3ARMONIA 
framework. Semantic queries are used by program navigation services in
order to find constructs in the user's program. In addition, queries
are also useful for incremental disambiguation. For instance,
when the user is up to a point in his input where he may enter an
expression, we may wish to identify what variable and method names are
currently in scope. We can use this information to restrict the number
of words that the speech recognizer will accept in order to achieve
higher accuracy rates. This will involve querying the partial parse
tree results and semantic attributes that have been analyzed up to
this point and ask for this information. The semantic query
functionality that will be used by this dissertation is being
implemented as part of the overall H-3ARMONIA project, and not as part
of this dissertation.

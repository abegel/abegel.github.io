Observations from the experiment</A>
</H2>

<P>
First, the experiment has several flaws. The students did not write
the program that they were asked to read. The students had about two
minutes to familiarize themselves with the code. The students were
reading from a page of pre-written code, rather than composing code on
the fly. There was no visual or audio feedback in response to code
dictation. Some of the users' utterances might be due to lack of
knowledge of where the cursor was, or whether or not the current block
of code was closed yet. Some students were unsure what style they
should use to speak the code. Some of them insisted on speaking all
punctuation, as if they were speaking into a keyboard, rather than to
another ``person'' (which were the instructions they were told).

<P>
However, despite its limitations, the experiment points towards some
of the capabilities we will need. We propose to conduct additional
experiments to guide our work. For example, this experiment deals only
with dictation, a component of authoring.  We need other experiments
to learn what capabilities are most valuable for high-level program
composition, navigation and editing.

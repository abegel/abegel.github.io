The Experiment</A>
</H2>

<P>
To understand how programming dictation might change in the presence
of vocal interaction, we designed an experiment to have
participants read a one-page pre-existing Java program out loud. Each
participant was told to read the code as if he were programming with a
partner on a group project. The participant was told that his partner
was sitting at the keyboard, and the participant had to get the gist
of the code across to his partner by reading it out loud. His
imaginary partner was assumed to be conversant in Java, programming,
and the project at hand. The experiment was intended to give some
insight into program dictation.

<P>
We carried out this experiment with ten computer science graduate
students, five of whom were familiar with Java, and five of whom were not,
but all of whom were programming-literate in some computer
language. We audio-taped all ten students, and transcribed their
recitations onto paper, keeping all utterances and performing little
semantic transformation (e.g., numbers are written as they are
pronounced, one fifty eight, rather than 158, but ``one'' is
disambiguated from ``won'' and ``eight'' is disambiguated from
``ate'').

<P>
The results of this experiment are instructive. We organize them into
three major categories: Java language design, vocal program dictation,
and vocal program composition.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Java language design</B>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Awkwardness by design</B>

<UL>
<LI><EM>Some Java language constructs are awkward in English.</EM> An example
is casting objects to a type. In Java, the cast comes before the type
- <TT>(int)foo</TT> - but in English, the noun needs to come before the
modifying verb, so people resorted to creating pronouns - ``cast an
object to int, that object is foo'' Some speakers reversed the order
of the statement - ``cast foo to int''.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Individual variability</B>

<UL>
<LI><EM>Students are inconsistent when they speak particular
constructs</EM>. For example, <TT>System.out.println</TT> is sometimes said
``system dot out dot print line'', and sometimes ``system out print
line.'' Even when the same person encountered the print statement
again, he might say it in a different form.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><EM>Most speakers verbalize most constructs the same way, but
there is great variability for other constructs</EM>. Examples of
recurring verbalizations are array reference: <TT>foo of i</TT>, <TT>foo sub
i</TT>, <TT>element i of array foo</TT>; and variable assignment: <TT>initialize foo
to 5</TT>, <TT>set foo to 5</TT>, <TT>foo equals 5</TT>, <TT>assign 5 to foo</TT>,
<TT>allocate a new array of length 5 to foo</TT>.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Ambiguous words and semantics</B>

<UL>
<LI><EM>Some of the ways that people speak particular constructs are
ambiguous, and often rely on non-verbal cues, or program context to
disambiguate them</EM>. An example is <TT>foo[i++]</TT> vs. <TT>foo[i]++</TT>. Many people said <TT>foo of i plus plus</TT> for both
constructs. Essentially this amounts to dropping the close bracket in
the array reference. English speakers inserted a pause before the
<TT>plus plus</TT> when saying the second statement; non-native English
speakers resorted to a restatement of the entire expression
(e.g. <TT>position i of array foo and then incremented by plus plus</TT>).

<P>
</LI>
<LI><EM>Some words that people say are homophones, that is, words that
sound the same</EM>. An example is <TT>to</TT> and <TT>two</TT>. The listener can
usually resolve this kind of ambiguity from context; a computing
system will have to do so as well.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Native English speakers vs. non-native English speakers</B> 

<UL>
<LI><EM>There are differences between native and non-native English
speakers</EM>.  Small non-English identifiers (like ``tur'', ``pat'',
``spp'') were spoken as syllables (word fragments) if possible by the
native English speakers in our sample, and spelled out otherwise. But
the non-native English speakers always spelled out all word fragments
even if they were pronounceable.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><EM>Some words in Java are unpronounceable even by native English
speakers</EM>. There were a variety of coping mechanisms: short words were
spelled out, long words were converted into verbalizable words. Some
programming language identifiers and keywords are shortened for ease
of typing (for instance, <TT>println</TT>), but when readers spoke these
words, they lengthened the words to their original long form (print
line).

</LI>
<LI><B>General program dictation</B>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Too few or two many words</B>

<UL>
<LI><EM>Students didn't say most of the punctuation
characters</EM>. Semicolons were never spoken, open and close parens as
part of method calls were never spoken. Sometimes the commas
separating arguments to a method call were spoken, but this was
inconsistent. Methods with more arguments tended to cause people to
say the comma. Dots marking qualified identifiers were sometimes
spoken and sometimes skipped, though it was far more common to say
them. Close curly braces were often ``translated'' into
context-sensitive terms (``then'' followed by ``close the if'', a
method body followed by ``end method'', etc). Open brackets for array
references were often translated into ``of'' or ``sub''. Close
brackets were not spoken. Quotes surrounding strings were rarely
spoken, even if the string had multiple words.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><EM>Speakers use a lot of extra words that are not part of the
programming language syntax, or even its descriptive metalanguage
(e.g. phrase names)</EM>.  This includes a lot of English-style phrasing
that is more comfortable for people than sticking to a very strict
programming language grammar. For example, speakers use articles
(``the'', ``a'', ``that'') and conjunctions (``and'', ``then'',
``after that'').

<P>
</LI>
<LI><EM>Speakers use lots of stop words (``uh'', ``um''), and repeated
words</EM>. Word repetitions are caused by a person thinking a bit and
then repeating the last few words that they said in order to form a
complete sentence.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><B>Speaker Mistakes</B>

<UL>
<LI><EM>Speakers make and correct mistakes with a small, but definite
frequency</EM>. There are usually indicator words like ``wait'', ``oh,
shoot'', and ``stop'' that begin an error correction phase. However,
this phase was more colloquial than something formally
stated. Speakers also add their own out-of-band comments like ``wow,
this is fun''.
</LI>

<LI><B>General program composition and navigation</B>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>High-level coding</B>

<UL>
<LI><EM>People spot patterns in the code and explain the pattern rather
than speaking the code word for word</EM>. For example, ``there's a
comment here, and this is what's inside...'', ``declare the
constructor'', ``now let's initialize a bunch of foo's fields'', ``we
need to catch these exceptions, foo and bar'', ``enlarge this pool
array by twice its length'', ``catch the exception and if that occurs
print the stack trace'', ``this method takes no arguments''.

<P>
</LI>
<LI><EM>Although this experiment was about sequential program dictation,
speakers used navigation keywords to move the ``cursor''
around</EM>. Examples include ``and the next method is'', ``close
method'', ``close that block'', ``and then you're going to have the
constructor'', ``start with package starlogo''.

Spoken Java</A>
</H2>

<P>
Using the results from our experiment, we are creating a dialect of
Java, called Spoken Java, with altered syntax to make it more natural
to speak. Why not develop a new language from scratch? Some
researchers studying programming for end-users believe new paradigms
might help programmers express themselves better. Natural
Programming&nbsp;[<A
 HREF="node29.html#myers98">39</A>] is one of several radical approaches to
programming from an HCI point of view. It advocates reinventing the
programming language in the style of how a child views process and
control. While this idea is interesting and may turn out to be
fruitful, we feel that designing a programming environment around an
existing language is easier to integrate into current curricula. We
don't want to teach students how to program from scratch; we want to
make their existing job programming easier. 

<P>
So why choose Java? We picked Java because it is widely-used in
education (at Berkeley in CS61b and CS164), as well as in the
corporate world, so our proof-of-concept will be readily
appreciated. In addition, there are many externally developed Java
analysis tools that we may plug into our H-3ARMONIA language analysis
framework. Notice, also, that we only change the <I>syntax</I> of Java,
not its semantics, because we know that semantics are hard to learn
(and hard to design correctly). If a student learns Java, they can
directly apply that knowledge outside of their classes.

<P>
The design of the Spoken Java grammar omits much of the punctuation
that makes the traditional Java syntax easy to parse. In fact, while
the original Java grammar is completely unambiguous, Spoken Java
currently has 400 ambiguities! How will we understand what code the
user is saying if there are so many ambiguities?

<P>
To solve this problem, we will build on our H-3ARMONIA language
analysis technology. The marriage of 16 years of research in
incremental lexical, syntactic and semantic analysis for programming
languages will help make vocal program dictation recognition feasible
and efficient.

Lexical Ambiguities</A>

<P>
There are several lexical ambiguities found in speech. The first
category is what I call one token, many spellings. The spoken voice
can not convey the capitalization which is important in many
programming languages. In addition, when the speech recognizer returns
a word, we may have actually said any number of homophones of that
word. For instance, if the speech recognizer returned ``one'', how can
we know that it was not ``won'' that we said? If we enhanced the token
data structure to allow alternate spellings, we could pass all
alternatives to the parser.

<P>
Another category of lexical ambiguity is alternate tokens for the same
input word. This is not due to homophones, but in fact to the language
defining the same word in multiple lexical categories. Explicitly
stated punctuation falls into this category. In Java, ``.'' is used to
separate identifiers and indicate field reference. Likewise, someone
may use ``period'' as an identifier for a variable. In a textual
representation, these two are easily distinguishable, but in a verbal
setting, we can't tell the difference. Thus, in order to support both
uses, we must pass two alternate tokens to the parser for this single
input word. This requires changing the lexer-parser interface to allow
more than one token to be passed when the ``next'' token is requested.

<P>
A third very important category of ambiguities occurs because the
speech recognizer can not regulate whitespace to the degree that a
text editor can. If there is a multi-word identifier (such as
``printLine''), we would say two words, ``print'' followed by
``line''. However, the speech recognizer will insert whitespace
between every word, even though in this case, that is not wanted. Our
solution for this ambiguity involves creating every possible
concatenation of tokens as single tokens for the parser. For example,
``foo bar moo'' would be sent as four alternate token streams: ``foo
bar moo'', ``foobar moo'', ``foo barmoo'', and ``foobarmoo''. Now,
lest we accidentally force the lexer to construct the power set of
input tokens, we can impose two constraints: first, only identifiers
may be concatenated together (we can design the language keywords to
eliminate multi-word tokens), and second, we can bound the number of
adjacent concatenated tokens based on the natural language of the
speaker. In English, there are few identifiers that consist of more
than five words concatenated together. On the other hand, in a
language like German, there might be a different limit. Each of these,
combined with aggressive automatic ambiguity resolution in the parser
and semantic analysis, will enable us to bound the amount of lexical
ambiguity this fact causes.

<P>
The last ambiguity concerns misrecognized tokens. Speech recognizers
have trouble with partial words and unpronounceable words, since they
are not found in its dictionaries. However, these are important
because legacy software often uses shorthand words for identifiers to
ease typing. Speech recognition systems come with pronunciation
feedback tools which recognize unpronounceable words and ask the user
to say them. Thereafter, when the user utters that sound again, the
speech recognizer will output the prechosen spelling of the word.

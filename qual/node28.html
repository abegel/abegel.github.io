Future Work and Conclusion </A>
</H1>

<P>
In the future beyond the scope of this dissertation, we see the development
of course additions to classes like CS61b (Introduction to Data
Structures) and CS164 (Introduction to Compiler Design), both taught
in Java, to support programming by voice acitivities. We envision
additional user studies to investigate the impact of verbal
programming on novice programmers, as well as explore how experts, both
with RSI and without, adapt to this new technology. Moving to a
classroom setting brings new challenges, such as identifying methods
to support collaborative verbal software development in noisy lab
sessions, and understanding how best to encourage students' expression in
software development tasks.

<P>
We also see new designs for verbalizing other programming languages,
such as C, C++, Javascript, and COOL (the language used in CS164). In
addition, since we speculate that native English speakers and
non-native English speakers verbalize code differently, we would like
to see grammars for C, Java and the like designed for non-native
English speakers. How might these dialects be different than those
designed for native speakers? Finally, we envision support for
gestures and drawings as alternate means of program
expression. Perhaps the user could a draw control flow or data flow
diagram as part of their code. Correctly and accurately parsing drawn
pictures is a tough research problem and will require more research
before the state-of-the-art becomes mature enough to tackle this
problem. 

<P>
In conclusion, the work described in this dissertation proposal will
help to answer three important questions. One, how do programmers
verbalize the software development process? How is this different than
writing?  Two, can we make a computer understand speech in support for
the software development process?  What algorithms and techniques will
be necessary to solve this problem? And three, can we create a
software development environment that supports this kind of
communication in a feasible manner? Will this environment make
programming easier and more efficient?

<P>
The current state-of-the-art in programming by voice leaves much to be
desired, both in terms of ease of use, and the quality of
recognition. By applying our expertise in programming language
analysis to the output of a speech recognizer, we hope to create an
environment that will support a more natural mode of verbal expression
by programmers. This framework will also support high-level linguistic
composition, editing, and navigation activities beyond simple program
dictation to create a complete solution for the programmer.

Dissertation Contributions</A>
</H1>

<P>
This dissertation will make several important contributions: enhancing the
H-3ARMONIA analysis framework, exploring how programmers verbalize
the software development process, developing high-level verbal
software development languages to naturally support program dictation,
composition, navigation, browsing, and editing, inventing and
evaluating the Spoken Java dialect, and conducting user studies to
evaluate the impact of voice on actual software development.

<P>
By the time we are finished, we will have enhanced three key
components of the H-3ARMONIA analysis framework: the lexer, the parser,
and the semantic analyzer. In the lexer, we will support alternate
lexeme values for a given lexeme. We will be able to pass multiple
alternate lexemes to the parser for a given input word. We will also
perform rule-based combinatoric concatentation of the lexical token
stream. In the parser, we will support alternate lexemes by performing
multiple shifts on each relevant parse graph. We will also enable each
parser to have its own pointer into the token stream (with
concatentation information as annotations) preserving GLR's parser
merging property. Additionally, we will better support speech input by
enhancing the parser with the ability to skip tokens from the input to
recover parsing when the user speaks extraneous words not found in the
grammar. Finally, we will implement a set-based, incremental,
demand-drive attribute grammar evaluator that works on ambiguous parse
forests. In addition, this evaluator will be able to perform automatic
disambiguation of parse forests (by pruning incorrect parse trees).

<P>
Second, we will conduct user studies to see how both novices and
experts verbalize the software development process in four different
task areas: program dictation, composition, navigation and browsing, and
editing. These user studies will inform our designs for spoken forms
of language grammars that support the five activities. 

<P>
Third, we will explore designs for spoken software development:
program dictation, composition, navigation and browsing, and
editing. We will develop methods to integrate speech recognition with
program composition to make the coding process simpler, faster and
easier. We will also identify new voice services required for editing,
and error correction. We will support manual disambiguation dialogues
with the user to resolve irresolvable ambiguities discovered by the
language analysis process.

<P>
Fourth, we will develop, refine and evaluate the Spoken Java dialect of
the Java programming language. This dialect will be designed with the
explicit purpose of making Java easy to speak and will be the main
testbed language for this dissertation. 

<P>
Finally, we will conduct user evaluation studies to explore the cognitive,
linguistic and practical aspects of the spoken software development
environment that we have created.

Writing vs. Speaking</A>

<P>
Programming is a form of communication which usually takes place in a
written medium. Even though the code itself is easily written down,
programmers need to convince others of their ideas through program
documentation, verbal explanations, gestures, and drawings. While
these extra forms of communication could be considered irrelevant to
the software artifact being created, they are an important part of the
software development process. Very few programmers work alone, and
very few work without someone evaluating their work. A programmer's
ability to communicate is vital for proper appreciation of their
work. 

<P>
What is the difference between the written output of a programmer and
his verbal output? The way that people express themselves when
speaking is fairly different than when writing. Three of these
differences (there are no doubt more) are relevant to
programming. First, we convey a lot of meaning through our vocal
expression. Whereas writing uses vocabulary, punctuation and
capitalization, speaking uses loudness, timbre, pitch, pauses and the
vernacular. Current speech recognition tools can not pick up any of
these qualities other than the words themselves, which leads to less
effective communication with the computer than by writing.

<P>
Abstraction is very important to spoken language communication. When
someone explains a concept to you, they first explain it at a
high-level. If at first you don't understand, they drop down to a
level of greater detail and explain how that works. Contrast this
process to writing programs. The high-level architectural system
structure is kept in the programmer's head, while instead, all the
details are written down to be understood by the computer. 

<P>
Lastly, when speaking, consistency and correctness are inferred by
context. People repeat words, drop words, misues words, flub
pronunciation, and employ their stream of consciousness. When writing
code, programmers revise and edit their work until it is perfect. When
the code is sent to the computer, it must be completely correct in
order for the computer to understand it. 

<P>
These three differences: expressiveness, abstraction and correctness,
are key to understanding how the programming and software development
process will differ when moving to programming by voice from
programming by keyboard. Current commercial speech tools do not
support recognition of vocal expression. In order to support the
abstraction that people bring to their spoken words, any program by
voice tool must eventually support higher-level linguistic
descriptions of programming. As we stated above, anecdotal evidence
suggests that when users talk about programs to one another, they
speak in terms of constructs and semantic properties rather than
textual entities. And finally, speech filtering and error correction
cannot solely occur in the speech recognizer; in order to properly fix
the error, filtering and error correction must take place in the
analysis layer that can handle it best, either in the lexer, parser or
semantic analyzer.

Evaluation of Program by Voice Systems</A>

<P>
We will explore the cognitive, linguistic and practical issues related
to spoken software development in several user studies. First, we will
explore how students (and expert programmers) communicate verbally
with each other to solve software engineering tasks. Then, we will
perform several Wizard of Oz studies to explore designs for verbal
program dictation, navigation and editing. These will be followed by
experiments on our actual editing framework as it is being built.

<P>
Our first studies will take place at the beginning of our project. We
want to see how two students communicate with each other in several
programming tasks: program composition, program navigation and program
editing. The first study will have one student dictate verbally
pre-written code to another student. The second study will see how two
students solve a simple programming task, where one of them works on
the programming task and verbally indicates to the other student what
to type into the computer. The second student will not work on the
problem. We will be watching the students to see what things they say
to each other to communicate the code, and how they go about solving
the problem. As we've stated previously, programmers do not code from
top to bottom; instead, they jump around. We want to identify how this
behavior manifests itself.

<P>
We will record these sessions using an addition to harmonia-mode for
XEmacs, which will use the speech recognition interface to record
audio clips (and text translation) of the words spoken by the first
student. The editor will record all activities into a log. This will
allow us to replay the session again without having to reconduct the
experiment. It will also allow us to revisit the original sessions to
mine more interesting ways to program as we develop new technology for
this project.

<P>
Our Wizard of Oz experiments will take the form of a student
performing a task verbally using prototypes of the Spoken Java
grammar. I will interpret their words using the same grammar while
typing the results of their actions into a text editor. We will
experiment with students dictating pre-written code, editing
pre-written code to alter its function, and solving a problem (of
the difficulty of a problem in CS61b) from scratch.

<P>
The initial set of experiments are intended to inform our editor and
grammar design process. Later, we will repeat these experiments (as
well as perform experiments on our prototype editor) and compare the
students' performance relative to traditional programming techniques
using the keyboard and mouse. Additionally, once students experiment
on the actual prototype editor, we will also compare performance using
voice-only techniques with voice-plus-keyboard-plus-mouse.

  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <title><![CDATA[Game Manual Rewrite]]></title>
    <summary><![CDATA[This project can be used for introductory students. The specific code attached here is applicable to students who are learning Java and have learned how to use 2D arrays and write their own classes. But, one can write their own &quot;poorly styled&quot; code for this assignment as well.<br />
<br />
Students are given a piece of code that works, but is poorly written with no documentation. They must first experiment with the program to figure out what it does. Once they do, they have to redesign the code, use good style and comment the code so that it solves the same problem, but is easier to read. In addition, the students must produce a user&#039;s manual for the finished product, so that someone can easily use the program.<br />

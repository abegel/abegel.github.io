  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <title><![CDATA[Code Review and Report to Programmer]]></title>
    <summary><![CDATA[Programmers should be able to read code from other programmers in order to determine whether it contains errors.  This includes compiler errors, runtime errors, and logic errors.  When they identify those errors, they should be able to provide feedback to the programmer who wrote the code in a way that is professional and productive.  In this assignment, students read a program, identify and classify the errors it contains, and write a summary to the programmer.  <br />

This could be easily modified to include code related to whatever content is being taught.  ]]></summary>

                                    <div class="element-text">At work, you will often be asked to read someone else’s code (either entire programs, or portions of programs) in order to identify errors and suggest ways to fix them. The other person may be a colleague working on another project or a member of a project team on which you serve. In these situations, you will be responsible not only for telling the person who programmed the code how to correct the problems but also for helping the programmer avoid those mistakes in the future.<br />
<br />
A critical professional ability is the ability to build rather than destroy positive interpersonal relationships when telling others about mistakes they’ve made and how to fix those mistakes. This ability will be especially important when you are working on a team.</div>

<title>Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum | Program Review Report</title>

<!-- Meta -->
<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8" />
<meta name="description" content="The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. <br />
&lt;p/&gt;<br />
The dissemination of the project&#039;s research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.<br />

The project manager has assigned your development team to evaluate one of the projects that was begun but not completed by the acquired company. Your evaluation report will include recommendations for completing the project. The project manager has asked your team to make a tenminute presentation summarizing the report. Your team’s evaluation report and presentation provides the project manager with critical information to plan how to develop the product. YOUR DELIVERABLES 1. The project manager has asked your team to prepare a five-to-seven-page evaluation report. 2. The project manager has asked your team to present significant findings from the evaluation report in a ten-minute meeting. WHAT YOUR READER WILL DO WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS YOU PROVIDE The manager must develop a plan for completing the project. Therefore, the manager wants your team to answer the following technical questions: 1. Does the program run? 2. What does the program do? 3. What is the current state of the program? 4. What is the current state of the project documentation? 5. What needs to be done to complete the project? You must provide answers to these questions in a manner that helps the manager develop a plan. The manager must evaluate your team to determine whether it is capable of completing the project. The manager will use your team’s report to answer the following questions: 1. Can your team correctly install the program? 2. Can your team identify and correct all incomplete and incorrect aspects of the program? 3. Are you and the other team members able to work together effectively? You need to present your information in a way that persuades the manager that your team is technically proficient and effective at collaborating on a complex project. LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT While working on this assignment, focus on developing your ability to perform these technical tasks: 1. Evaluate installation of existing project software. 2. Analyze operation of the program. 3. Identify, describe, and test (reproduce) bugs. 4. Analyze documentation to determine each document’s purpose, accuracy, and usefulness. 5. Create a development plan for a program based on evaluations of its installation, operation, bugs, and documentation. 6. Identify the key technical information about a program that the project manger wants when deciding how to create a development plan with an incomplete project. 1<br />

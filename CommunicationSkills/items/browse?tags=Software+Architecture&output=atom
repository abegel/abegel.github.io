  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

The audience for this document is other software engineers (not the client). The Software Architecture Document describes the big ideas of the design and implementation of your software. It is written for future software engineers who need to understand the how the system is implemented. For example, next semester a new team might take over your project and will need to understand the rationale behind your design and how the software is organized. Information like this is especially important for products like ours which we hope will be used for many years to come. The SAD is a compilation of “technical” design documents. These can include:<br />
• Text descriptions, such as technical memos, that summarize important design decisions or characteristics<br />
• Design diagrams, such as UML class and sequence diagrams, that describe static and dynamic design of your software<br />
<br />
In this memo to your supervisor please document an important architectural decision made in for implementation of your team project.  Your supervisor will use this to monitor the quality of the product’s implementation.</div>

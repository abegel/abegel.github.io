  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <summary><![CDATA[This is the second of many milestones associated with the project. You will be using the ER diagram and problem statement you developed in the previous <a href="http://cs-comm.lib.muohio.edu/items/show/30">milestone</a> in this assignment. You will refer back to the relational schema developed in this assignment in future milestones to a) <a href="http://cs-comm.lib.muohio.edu/items/show/42">Analyze the design for privacy and security issues</a>, b) Design the software system and c) Develop and test the information system. This assignment has the following learning outcomes: ● To learn how to design a Relational Schema and specify entity-integrity and referential integrity constraints given the Entity-Relationship diagram, and the requirements of an information system. ● To learn how to apply the practice of relational schema design in a situation similar to those seen in the industry. ● To learn how to work within a team to resolve conflicts and accommodate varied design choices. This is a team assignment and is ideally done in a team of three to four students.]]></summary>

Please note that your relational schema must have the ability to store the required data in an efficient manner without any duplication.<br />

A critical ability while working within a team is to develop an ability to manage conflicts, accommodate different design decisions, and manage conflicting client requirements. This milestone helps you apply these abilities in a real life situation.<br />

  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

After all, practitioners within this field are oftentimes called computer programmers.  However, in most cases, coding will be a small part or what we actually do.  One specific example is testing.<br />
<br />
It is important for us to understand the benefits and implications of each of our responsibilities as we move forward into our career.  To do this, we must have good information to help us schedule our time and prioritize.  In addition, we must be able to communicate this information to others so that they have similar priorities.<br />

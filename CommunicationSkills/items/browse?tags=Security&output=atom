  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <title><![CDATA[Security and Privacy Analysis of a Database]]></title>
    <summary><![CDATA[This is the third of many milestones associated with the project. You will be making use of the problem statement and schema design you developed in <a href="http://cs-comm.lib.muohio.edu/items/show/30">Milestone 1</a> and <a href="http://cs-comm.lib.muohio.edu/items/show/51">Milestone2</a> in this assignment. You will refer back to the security &amp; privacy concerns, business, entity and referential constraints developed in this assignment in future milestones to a) Implement the design, b) Design the software system and c) Develop and test the information system. This assignment has the following learning outcomes: ● To learn how to identify data that might have privacy implications, determine adequate access control policies and implement mechanisms to enforce said policies. ● To learn how to identify potential security vulnerabilities in an information system, implications of such vulnerabilities and actions necessary to protect the system from said vulnerabilities. ● To learn how to identify entity and referential integrity constraints on the data and define policies for handling referential integrity constraints. ● To learn how to identify business rule constraints on the information systems and determine policies for enforcing said rules. ● To learn how to describe design choices with respect to physical database design and rationalize that in a manner that enables a software engineer to implement the design in a relational database system. ● To learn how to apply the practice of physical data design in a situation similar to those seen in the industry. ● To learn how to work within a team to resolve conflicts and accommodate varied design choices. This is a team assignment and is ideally done in a team of 3-4 students.]]></summary>

                                    <div class="element-text">As a software engineer you will often be required to design information systems based on a client’s requirements. It is your responsibility to understand the needs behind the information system, develop a feature set based on the needs and produce a design for the information system. Once you have designed the information system, you will be often be responsible for analyzing the design to identify privacy issues, security vulnerabilities and identify and implement access control policies and mechanisms to prevent security breaches. You will also be required to enforce entity, referential and business rules to ensure that your information system provides a true representation of the real world data. <br />
<br />
A critical ability while working within a team is to develop an ability to manage conflicts, accommodate different design decisions, and manage conflicting client requirements. This milestone helps you learn and apply these abilities in a real life situation.<br />

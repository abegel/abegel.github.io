  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

                                    <div class="element-text">In this assignment your team will make an oral presentation, summarizing the results of the Inception Phase, to your client, co-workers, and supervisor. You should summarize the content of the artifacts produced in the Inception Phase (Vision, Use Case Model, Glossary, and Supplementary Specification).  You should create visual aids (such as a PowerPoint deck, handouts, etc) to supplement your presentation.<br />
<br />
The ability to present information orally to a variety of audiences is a very important skill to learn and practice. It probably goes without saying that you will be called upon in your internships and career to present information orally, but you will probably also want to make such presentations to social groups and a variety of other organizations with which you become a member.<br />
<br />
An oral presentation is a prepared, purposeful presentation designed to increase knowledge, foster understanding, or promote change in the listeners’ attitudes, values, beliefs, or behaviors. In our case we want to foster understanding within your team, your supervisor, and the client that we have a good understanding of the project’s overall goals and scope.<br />

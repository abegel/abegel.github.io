  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

]]></title>
    <summary><![CDATA[Implementation of a graph data structure and the Traveling Salesperson problem using the standard template library; short proofs of correctness.<br />
<br />
In this assignment the student will implement two graph representation structures (adjacency matrix and adjacency list), each inherited from a common abstract graph class, and use these as the bases for an implementation of an exhaustive search TSP solution.  Students will compete for fastest implementation (as measured by the amount of nodes that can be processed in a give time limit), ideally leading them to devise branch-and-bound improvements to the exhaustive search.  The students are also intended to use this as a chance to gain experience with the C++ Standard Template Library, using the Vector and List container classes as the basis for their graph representation.<br />
<br />
Duration: The project is split in to two parts, intended to require one week each.<br />
<br />
Background: Students are assumed to have had: at least 2.5 semesters of programming experience, including at least .5 semesters of C++; knowledge of the Vector and List STL templates; exposure to recursion and depth-first search.   For the assignment the instructor will need to explain the adjacency matrix and adjacency list graph representations.<br />

                                    <div class="element-text">Suppose you are working tech. support for Starbuck’s, and have to tackle the problem of delivery truck routing.  Specifically: you need to write a program that will take the location of a supply center and a list of Starbuck locations that are resupplied from that center, and produces a route that will get a truck from the supply center to each of the stores and back while driving the minimum number of miles possible (and hence, presumably, minimizing both fuel and labor costs).  It turns out that writing a program to find these optimal route in polynomial time is a really difficult.  However, if you are not worried about runtime then the algorithm becomes straight-forward.  And really, really slow.  You need to design the best tool you can, and be prepared to explain (in writing) why it works to a colleague, boss, or even to yourself.<br />
<br />
This is an example of the Traveling Salesperson Problem, a problem that shows up (in some variation) in many important applications.  If you are going to address it, you probably want to model the problem with a graph: each node represents a store location, while edges represent distance.  Graphs are one of the most useful general models in Computer Science, and having the correct, efficient, implementation of the Graph ADT (along with basic functionality) is of some importance.  In this assignment you will implement the two most commonly used graph data types, and on top of that write a TSP implementation.  <br />

When designing the classes (objects) we need to answer the following key questions:<br />
• What software classes should we implement to produce the product?<br />
• What are the responsibilities of each class (what are the attributes and methods)?<br />
• How do the classes interact with one another and the actors?<br />
<br />
Class diagrams and sequence diagrams are visual tools that help us to explore possible answers to the above design questions, and to document our decisions. Class and sequence diagrams are very commonly used design tools, so knowledge of these tools should be helpful to you in your future studies or career.  In addition, the two diagrams model different aspects of the software, so the two diagrams are complementary. <br />
<br />
In this memo to your supervisor you will summarize the purpose of static and dynamic models and give your own opinion on which type of model is most challenging and useful aid to software design.</div>

Plus, there are some severe issues with the code – including it won’t even compile.  The objectives for this assignment are to (1) gain experience understanding code, (2) learn proper debugging techniques, and (3) work on writing a technical report.  In this particular example, we used Conway&#039;s &quot;Game of Life&quot;.<br />

Technical Task:  When working in the real-world, many times you will be given an existing piece of code that you must understand before you can implement any enhancements or fixes.  And many times, the original developer of the code is no longer available – leaving you to figure out what the code is doing.<br />
Professional Setting:  Students works for a company that has purchased another.<br />
Professional Role:  Students are members of a project team.<br />
Deliverable:  Bug/Enhancement report.<br />
Real-world Audience:  A project manager.<br />
How the Audience will USE the student&#039;s communication:  The project manager will use the students&#039; report to develop a plan for completing the project.<br />

One specific example is testing.<br />

It is important for us to understand the benefits and implications of each of our responsibilities as we move forward into our career.  To do this, we must have good information to help us schedule our time and prioritize.  In addition, we must be able to communicate this information to others so that they have similar priorities.<br />

                                    <div class="element-text">Workplace Scenario:<br />
You have been hired to design a new Starbucks locator smart phone app.  The app will download with a list of U.S. Starbucks locations.  When activated, the app will be provide with the coordinates by the device GPS, and locate the closest Starbucks to the current position (which it can then feed to a map app that will be in charge of calculating the route).  Your problem is to figure out how to maintain the list in such a way that it can be quickly queried. You could just scan the full list – but given the size of the list, and the user’s speed expectations, that isn’t going to make for a happy client.  You need to do better for that.<br />
<br />
On the bright side: you can consider the list static.  New Starbucks do not open all that often.  So your data structure does not need to support an insert data structure.  (When there is an update, you can just reconstruct the entire data structure from the modified list during down time.)  So you priority is the query runtime.  The user need to find the closest Starbuck’s as fast as possible – the user needs coffee now!!!<br />
<br />
<br />
Importance: In this you will gain experience with dictionary data structures by designing and implementing a data structure that support fast “nearest neighbor” queries.  The ideal data structure for the assignment is a space-dividing structure such as the kd-tree; implementations based on this will be considerably faster than any alternative without sacrificing on precision.  There are, however, many alternatives – students unable to implement such a structure will be able to make use of simpler structure, at a significant loss of time and/or precision (and, hence, length).<br />

The next step is to design the software. This will be documented using a UML diagram. The audience is the software developers, who will use them to code the system. The resulting code will then be tested using the test procedures provided.<br />
<br />
After completing the task, you will write a project post-mortem report describing how long it took to implement the project, what issues you encountered, how your design changed, and why you needed to make these changes (there is also a project reflection component to this which is not intended to be true to a workplace context). The purpose of the report is to provide insight to improve the design and estimation for future projects. The main audiences are your manager, yourself, and other developers.   The project reflection will be used by your instructor to improve future projects.<br />

                                    <div class="element-text">The purpose of this assignment is to explore two Extreme Programming (XP) practices: test-driven development and refactoring. The practice of test-driven development calls for software developers to create tests before code is actually produced. The example in Chapter 21 is based on unit testing, but test-driven development can be applied to other tests, such as feature tests, usability tests, load tests, etc. <br />
<br />
Refactoring is a programming practice aimed at refining code without changing its behavior (it is not debugging). Over time about 100 named refactoring patterns have been identified. <br />
<br />
In this memo to your supervisor, you will summarize the key points behind test-drive development and refactoring, and you will identify an example of how refactoring can be applied.<br />
<br />
Test-driven development and refactoring are practices that you can apply now in your other classes, and later in an internship or in your career.<br />

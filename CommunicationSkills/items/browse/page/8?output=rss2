<br />
Students start with the implementation of a basic linked last class and selected functionality designed to force them to thin through the issues of modifying lists without destroying list integrity.  Following this then they use the list to model a standard deck of cards, and implement a Monte Carlo simulation to determine the required number of times the deck must be shuffled in order to ensure a random ordering.<br />
<br />
Duration: 2 weeks<br />
<br />
Background: The student must be familiar with basic C++ syntax, C++ classes, and basic C++ memory management.  There is no assumption of a statistical background: relevant statistical tools (chi-square) is explained at high-level in the documentation and is provided as a code library.<br />

                                    <div class="element-text">You have been hired by a major Casino chain to verify the Bayer-Diaconis theorem, which purports to prove how many times a 52-card playing deck must be riffle-shuffled in order to completely randomize it (that is, make sure that, when done, each card could be anywhere in the deck with equal probability – regardless of where it started.).  It is extremely important to the Casino that, before each deal at the Black Jack table, a deck be shuffled enough to make the order random. Failure to do so could lead to potential biases that a player might exploit.  But Bayer-Diaconis is an analytic proof – a logical deduction from first principles.  Your employer wants empirical evidence that Bayer-Diaconis is correct.  One possibility is to have you shuffle the desk for a few billion years and track where the cards end up, but that is impractical.  What is practical is to run a simulation and apply a basic statistical tool to establish the actual bound.<br />
<br />
Importance: Using simulation to study the behavior of complex systems is one of the primary functions of Computer Science, and this project will expose you to some of the basic principles of the area.  At a lower level, it will also require you to work with linked lists – arguably one of the two most important data structures we use.  <br />
<br />
You will also be asked to read investigate the linked-list data structure and discuss aspects of the reading.  In reality, you will often need to pick a data structure appropriate to your problem, frequently choosing between established structures you are unfamiliar with.  This will involve a certain degree of research: reading and understanding papers or text on the options, and possibly defending your decision to a colleague, boss, or client.  The questions in this assignment are intended both to test your understanding and to make sure you can coherently explain what you have learned to another party.  <br />

(This is the product your team evaluated in the Product Review Report, developed customer requirements for in the Customer Requirements Report, and developed a prioritized bug/enhancement list for in the Prioritized Bug/Enhancement Report.) The product manager has assigned your development team to select and implement project management tools. Specifically, the project manager wants your team’s recommendation on the following:  Process management tool (i.e., a tool to manage the development process)  Configuration management tool (i.e., a tool to manage the product code) Your team’s report needs to recommend tools that your team will use to effectively and efficiently manage product development. The project manager has asked your team to make a ten-minute presentation summarizing the report. Your team’s report and presentation provides the project manager with critical information to plan how to develop the product. YOUR DELIVERABLES 1. The project manager has asked your team to prepare a three-to-five-page project management tools report. 2. The project manager has asked your team to present significant findings from the project management tools report in a ten-to-fifteen-minute meeting. WHAT YOUR READER WILL DO WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS YOU PROVIDE The manager must develop a plan for completing the project. Therefore, the manager wants your team to answer the following technical questions: 1. What process management tool is best suited to manage the development process? 2. What configuration management tool is best suited to manage the development process? 3. What resources are needed to implement and maintain the recommended project management tools? You must provide answers to these questions in a manner that helps the manager develop a plan. The manager must evaluate your team to determine whether it is capable of completing the project. The manager will use your team’s report to answer the following questions: 1. Can your team evaluate and select project management tools? 2. Can your team implement and maintain project management tools? 3. Can your team document tool installation and maintenance for new team members? 4. Are you and the other team members able to work together effectively? You need to present your information in a way that persuades the manager that your team is technically proficient and effective at collaborating on a complex project. LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT While working on this assignment, focus on developing your ability to perform these technical tasks: 1. Evaluate key features of process management tools for a development project. 1<br />

Technical Task:  Most real-world software development projects involve working as a team.  <br />
Professional Setting:  Students work for a software company.<br />
Professional Role:  Students are members   <br />
Deliverable:  Design document.<br />
Real-world Audience:  A project manager.<br />
How the Audience will USE the students&#039; communication:  The project manager will use the students&#039; design document to do the following:  (1) Develop a plan for completing the project, and (2) Determine whether the team is capable of completing the project.<br />
Additional Notes:  Whether it is working with other developers, business people, managers, customers, or users, you must be able to adapt to different personalities and deliver a working product that meets the customer’s requirements. <br />
<br />
<br />
ADDITIONAL SCENARIO:<br />
Also, as a software developer in the work force, you may have to do some research to find a solution to a problem.  In this assignment, you will be given a task (handling of the probability of a customer arriving) for which there is not a solution in your textbook.  For example, this will require you to read other resources (such as the internet) to understand how to do random number generation.<br />

Creation of the backlog is the first step in the Scrum process.  The product backlog will be used to plan the first Elaboration sprint. Each team member will help to create the initial backlog by more fully developing a use case for the class project.  In this memo to your supervisor, you will write a more detailed use case for one of the features of your team’s project.<br />
<br />
Learning to write use cases, and using the Scrum process, will help you in an internship or job since many organizations use these approaches.<br />

You will be making use of the problem statement and schema design you developed in <a href="http://cs-comm.lib.muohio.edu/items/show/30">Milestone 1</a> and <a href="http://cs-comm.lib.muohio.edu/items/show/51">Milestone2</a> in this assignment. You will refer back to the security &amp; privacy concerns, business, entity and referential constraints developed in this assignment in future milestones to a) Implement the design, b) Design the software system and c) Develop and test the information system. This assignment has the following learning outcomes: ● To learn how to identify data that might have privacy implications, determine adequate access control policies and implement mechanisms to enforce said policies. ● To learn how to identify potential security vulnerabilities in an information system, implications of such vulnerabilities and actions necessary to protect the system from said vulnerabilities. ● To learn how to identify entity and referential integrity constraints on the data and define policies for handling referential integrity constraints. ● To learn how to identify business rule constraints on the information systems and determine policies for enforcing said rules. ● To learn how to describe design choices with respect to physical database design and rationalize that in a manner that enables a software engineer to implement the design in a relational database system. ● To learn how to apply the practice of physical data design in a situation similar to those seen in the industry. ● To learn how to work within a team to resolve conflicts and accommodate varied design choices. This is a team assignment and is ideally done in a team of 3-4 students.</div>

It is your responsibility to understand the needs behind the information system, develop a feature set based on the needs and produce a design for the information system. Once you have designed the information system, you will be often be responsible for analyzing the design to identify privacy issues, security vulnerabilities and identify and implement access control policies and mechanisms to prevent security breaches. You will also be required to enforce entity, referential and business rules to ensure that your information system provides a true representation of the real world data. <br />
<br />
A critical ability while working within a team is to develop an ability to manage conflicts, accommodate different design decisions, and manage conflicting client requirements. This milestone helps you learn and apply these abilities in a real life situation.<br />

<br />
In this assignment students will implement both a simple caeser cypher, followed by an RSA encryption/decryption functions, using only constructs supported in C (malloc/free, C-style strings, and the C string.h functions; use of streams is still permitted).  Given these restrictions, the students are forced to grapple with typical memory management issues (e.g. memory allocation, pointer-based parameter passing, segmentation faults) while implementing a tool many will find interesting.<br />
<br />
Duration: 3 weeks<br />
<br />
Background: Students are assumed to have 1-2 semesters of an imperative or objected oriented language (e.g. Java) and to have seen the basic syntax of C, but are not assumed to have worked with pointers.   All required background on RSA and related number theory is explained within the lab (or hidden in provided code), but the student may need supplemental instruction on the basic C functions (e.g. malloc, strcat) and C bit-operators (by the instructor or through some written text).<br />

                                    <div class="element-text">You are a programmer for a tech. company who has been tasked with setting up a protocol for secure communications – allowing users to exchange emails without that cannot be read by outsiders.  To do so you will implement RSA public-key encryption; because the speed of encryption/decryption is considered a priority, you will implement these in C (as opposed to C++ or Java).<br />
<br />
From a pedagogical perspective, the point of this assignment is to give you exposure to C-style programming, helping you to understand memory manipulation.   We will continue to use the C++ compiler (avoiding the hassle of installing a C compiler), but you will be restricted to using only C libraries.   Hence you experience working with the C programming language, and have you think about issues that C++ frequently (and Java always) hides from the programmer.  In the course of this project you will also look at both a common cipher algorithm and RSA, one of the core encryption algorithms.  RSA was the first public-key encryption algorithm, and the mathematics on which it is built is similar to many more sophisticated encryption algorithms.  You are not expected to understand the mathematical basis for RSA, but by the end of this project you should understand how public-private encryption key pairs are generated, how they are used, and why they are so useful in computer security.<br />

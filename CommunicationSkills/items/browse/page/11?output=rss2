It is your responsibility to ensure that the information system has the ability to store the required data in an efficient manner without any duplication. The ER diagram is an industry standard and provides a visual representation of the database design. The ER diagram is the focal point of communication with the client and should be  easy to read, modify and capture all the constraints to be represented in the database.</div>

                                    <div class="element-text">You will likely be involved in some aspect of software development or acquisition in your internships and your career after graduation. This assignment will engage you in thinking about the way that software development projects are organized and managed. In addition, you likely will be asked to look for alternative problem solving approaches, summarize those to your supervisor, and make a recommendation. This is also a part of this assignment.<br />
<br />
For small programs such as those you have done in class you can probably conceptualize the entire solution in your mind and write your code without a lot of pre-planning. But for larger computer systems that you will encounter in an internship or in your career, the solution can’t be done by a single person. These systems require teams of people who maybe be separated by distance and time. To solve large problems, in a team environment, requires a structured or organized process. We call that organized process a software development methodology. These roadmaps are called Software Development Methodologies.  This seems like a straight-forward process, but many computer-systems have failed due to flaws in the process.<br />
<br />
This assignment introduces contrasting software development methodologies so that you are aware that there are choices to be made and for you to think about which process you believe would be most likely help you to successfully complete the class project on time while meeting the needs of our client.<br />
<br />
Write a memo to your supervisor in which you compare the waterfall approach with the iterative approach, and recommend an approach to use in our class project. </div>

The rubric includes separate items for both the technical part of the assignment (writing the class) and the Javadoc part of the assignment.  This could be easily modified to incorporate Javadocs with some other programming assignment.<br />

PRIORITIZED BUG/ENHANCEMENT REPORT 1. Technical Task Using a Product Review Report and the customer requirements identified in a Customer Requirements Report, your team is to create a plan for completing a project. To create this plan, you are to do the following: ● Develop criteria to facilitate and justify bug and enhancement ranking. ● Create a prioritized list of bugs and enhancements. ● Estimate time and resources needed to fix each bug and implement each enhancement. ● Recommend the order in which bugs and enhancements should be developed to meet customer needs You work for an employer that has acquired another company. The acquired company had begun a project that your employer would like to complete. You are members of development team You are to create a three-to-five-page prioritized bug/enhancement report. Your development team’s project manager Using your report, the manager must develop a plan for completing the project. Therefore, she wants your report to answer the following questions: 1. What are the critical criteria that should be used to organize the development process? 2. How critical is each bug or enhancement to the development process? 3. What are the key features of each bug or enhancement? 4. What resources are required to fix each bug or implement each enhancement? 5.

<br />
PRIORITIZED BUG/ENHANCEMENT REPORT Your project manager decided to continue development of a product begun but not completed by an acquired company. She has asked your development team to prepare a bug/enhancement report based on bugs identified in the Product Review Report and customer requirements identified in the Customer Requirements Report. YOUR DELIVERABLE Three-to-five-page prioritized bug/enhancement report. YOUR READER Your project manager. WHAT YOUR READER WILL DO WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS YOU PROVIDE The manager must develop a plan for completing the project. Therefore, she wants your report to answer the following questions: 1. What are the critical criteria that should be used to organize the development process? 2. How critical is each bug or enhancement to the development process? 3. What are the key features of each bug or enhancement? 4. What resources are required to fix each bug or implement each enhancement? 5. Does your team have the technical and communication abilities needed to complete his project? 6. Should I accept your team’s recommendations? You must answer these questions in a manner that helps the manager develop a plan efficiently. You must prepare a communication that persuades the manager that you have the technical knowledge required to plan a complex project. YOUR TASKS You must perform the following technical tasks: ● Develop criteria to facilitate and justify bug and enhancement ranking. ● Create a prioritized list of bugs and enhancements. ● Estimate time and resources needed to fix each bug and implement each enhancement. ● Recommend the order in which bugs and enhancements should be developed to meet customer needs. You must perform the following communication tasks: ● Write a report that helps the project manager make practical decisions efficiently. ● Write a report that builds the manager’s confidence in your team’s technical and communication abilities. ● Write a report that persuades the manger to accept your recommendation<br />

WRITTEN AND ORAL PROJECT SPECIFICATION AND PROPOSAL 1. Technical Task Your team is to create a new idea for a database, including a specification for it and a high-level plan for achieving it. The specification should be a document that describes the following: • Your project (for example, what application will you build and what features will be built). • Your application design for meeting project’s minimal requirements. The application design should include “screenshots.” You work for a company in which a single project manager supervises several teams that meet together frequently to discuss new and ongoing projects. You are members of one of the teams. You have the following deliverables: 1. A written specification that includes screenshots. 2. A five-minute presentation that shows screenshots. Your project manager and the other teams. Your manager and co-workers will decide whether it is worth pursuing the project further (i.e., is it worth the organization’s time to have you prepare a detailed proposal for the project). Your co-workers will compare your application design against your specification to determine whether your proposed design meets the minimal requirements of the specification.<br />

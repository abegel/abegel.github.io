The Prioritized Bug/Enhancement Report is third of five assignments that prepare students to develop the software they evaluated in the Program Review Report assignment over four two-week scrum cycles. <br />
<br />
Students perform the following technical tasks: <br />
1.	Synthesize results from the Product Review Report and the Customer Requirements Report to develop critical criteria to organize the development process.<br />
2.	Prioritize bug fixes and enhancements using the critical organizing criteria.<br />
3.	Identify the key features of each bug fix and enhancement.<br />

(This is the product your team evaluated in the Product Review Report and developed customer requirements for in the Customer Requirements Report.) The product manager has assigned your development team to develop a prioritized bug/enhancement list based on bugs identified in the Product Review Report and customer requirements identified in the Customer Requirements Report.  Your team needs to develop criteria to facilitate and justify bug and enhancement ranking.  Your team needs to create a prioritized list of bugs and enhancements.  Your team needs to estimate time and resources needed to fix each bug and implement each enhancement. Your team’s report needs to recommendation the order in which bugs and enhancements should be developed to meet customer needs. The project manager has asked your team to make a ten-minute presentation summarizing the report. Your team’s report and presentation provides the project manager with critical information to plan how to develop the product. YOUR DELIVERABLES 1. The project manager has asked your team to prepare a three-to-five-page prioritized bug/enhancement report. 2. The project manager has asked your team to present significant findings from the prioritized bug/enhancement report in a ten-to-fifteen-minute meeting. WHAT YOUR READER WILL DO WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS YOU PROVIDE The manager must develop a plan for completing the project. Therefore, the manager wants your team to answer the following technical questions: 1. What are the critical criteria that organize the development process? 2. How critical is each bug or enhancement to the development process? 3. What are the key features of each bug or enhancement? 4. What resources are required to fix each bug or implement each enhancement? You must provide answers to these questions in a manner that helps the manager develop a plan. The manager must evaluate your team to determine whether it is capable of completing the project. The manager will use your team’s report to answer the following questions: 1. Can your team synthesize the results of the Program Review Report and Customer Requirements Report to identify product development critical criteria? 2. Can your team organize a list of bug fixes and enhancements organized by the product development criteria? 3. Can your team estimate time and people needed to complete each bug fix and enhancement? 4. Are you and the other team members able to work together effectively?<br />

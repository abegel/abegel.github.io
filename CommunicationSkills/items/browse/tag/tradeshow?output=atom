  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <title><![CDATA[Final Poster, Presentation &amp; Demo]]></title>
    <summary><![CDATA[This assignment allows presenters the opportunity to orally summarize their team’s project in a very short amount of time (2.5-3 minutes) for a diverse audience.  Within that amount of time, the presenter will need to attract the audience, sell the project idea and show technical expertise.  As a part of this event, the entire team has the opportunity to demonstrate their project using a tradeshow approach.  This gives students experience listening to and answering questions one-on-one or with small numbers of interested parties.  Students also gain experience with developing professional posters.]]></summary>

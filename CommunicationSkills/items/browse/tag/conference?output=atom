  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <summary><![CDATA[“Incorporating Communication Learning Outcomes<br />
Across the Computer Science (CS) and Software Engineering<br />
(SE) Curriculum” is an NSF-funded project that aims to identify<br />
the communication skills, specifically those involving reading,<br />
writing, speaking, and teaming, needed by CS and SE graduates<br />
and then determine how these skills can be taught within CS and<br />
SE curricula. This paper presents the results of our first two<br />
years of studying the programs at Miami University and North<br />
Carolina State University to determine the kinds of<br />
communication utilized in our courses and how communication is<br />
taught and assessed. When looking at student attitudes towards<br />
communication our analyses suggest that students do not<br />
consider technical (professional) activities such as code reading,<br />
writing, and inspections as communication activities, and the<br />
same applies to more complex genres such as software testing or<br />
design. They also appear to have difficulty relating writing and<br />
reading that may take place in the context of the courses to what<br />
they might be doing as software engineers and computer<br />
scientists once they start working. On the other hand, initial<br />
results indicate that our students’ communications skills increase<br />
steadily throughout their stay in the university. We have also<br />
identified potential strategies for improved instruction in<br />
communication.]]></summary>

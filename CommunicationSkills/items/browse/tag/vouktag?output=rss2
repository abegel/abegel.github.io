You will create a project specification and a presentation.  The specification should be a document describing your project (for example what application will you build and what features will be built), and how you meet the project’s minimal requirements.  The presentation will be a summary of the specification. The presentation should include “screenshots” of the application design.<br />
<br />
This assignment is the first part of the largest project in a database class.  The students are given an application domain and have to prepare the specifics of the project.  This involves teaming, writing, and speaking.  </div>

WRITTEN AND ORAL PROJECT SPECIFICATION AND PROPOSAL 1. Technical Task Your team is to create a new idea for a database, including a specification for it and a high-level plan for achieving it. The specification should be a document that describes the following: • Your project (for example, what application will you build and what features will be built). • Your application design for meeting project’s minimal requirements. The application design should include “screenshots.” You work for a company in which a single project manager supervises several teams that meet together frequently to discuss new and ongoing projects. You are members of one of the teams. You have the following deliverables: 1. A written specification that includes screenshots. 2. A five-minute presentation that shows screenshots. Your project manager and the other teams. Your manager and co-workers will decide whether it is worth pursuing the project further (i.e., is it worth the organization’s time to have you prepare a detailed proposal for the project). Your co-workers will compare your application design against your specification to determine whether your proposed design meets the minimal requirements of the specification.<br />

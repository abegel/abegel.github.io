  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <title><![CDATA[Car Wash Simulation Using Queues]]></title>
    <summary><![CDATA[A queue is a popular data structure that is commonly used when attempting to process requests.  In this assignment you will use a queue to simulate the processing of customer requests to wash their car.  The objectives in this assignment are to (1) gain experience researching for a solution to a problem, (2) create a high-level design as a team that can be used by developers as well as understood by non-technical people (e.g., a customer), (3) build queue methods for adding, removing, and calculating averages, and (4) improve the implementation of proper coding styles and documentation.<br />
<br />
This is a team assignment, and students should understand basic constructs, standard I/O, and how to implement a queue.<br />

Technical Task:  Most real-world software development projects involve working as a team.  <br />
Professional Setting:  Students work for a software company.<br />
Professional Role:  Students are members   <br />
Deliverable:  Design document.<br />
Real-world Audience:  A project manager.<br />
How the Audience will USE the students&#039; communication:  The project manager will use the students&#039; design document to do the following:  (1) Develop a plan for completing the project, and (2) Determine whether the team is capable of completing the project.<br />
Additional Notes:  Whether it is working with other developers, business people, managers, customers, or users, you must be able to adapt to different personalities and deliver a working product that meets the customer’s requirements. <br />
<br />
<br />
ADDITIONAL SCENARIO:<br />
Also, as a software developer in the work force, you may have to do some research to find a solution to a problem.  In this assignment, you will be given a task (handling of the probability of a customer arriving) for which there is not a solution in your textbook.  For example, this will require you to read other resources (such as the internet) to understand how to do random number generation.<br />

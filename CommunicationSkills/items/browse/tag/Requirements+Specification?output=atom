  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <title><![CDATA[Written Project Report]]></title>
    <summary><![CDATA[A written draft of project progress report that includes sections describing: requirements, design, implementation, testing and task plans.  Student team works together to develop audience-sensitive written project progress reports.  This assignment allows students to organize and record their project progress.  Each student gains experience with writing/editing as a team; as they write, there will be many opportunities to clarify issues and ask questions.  The task plan portion of the report will clearly delineate action items and due dates.  As team writes this progress report, requirements are listed and hence a related design can be created.  Oftentimes, preliminary code is also written/tested as a result of this activity.  The entire activity of preparing this report assists team with moving forward to next phase of project.<br />

    <summary><![CDATA[This is the first of many milestones associated with a 6 week project. You will refer back to the requirements and design developed in this assignment in future milestones to a) <a href="http://cs-comm.lib.muohio.edu/items/show/51"> Implement the design</a>, b) <a href="http://cs-comm.lib.muohio.edu/items/show/42">Analyze the design for privacy and security issues</a>, c) Design the software system and d) Develop and test the information system. This assignment has the following learning outcomes: ●To learn how to draft the requirements of an information system project using a problem statement. ●To learn how to draft a problem statement using the Function- Form&ndash;Economy-Time Model (FFET) ●To learn how to design an Entity-Relationship diagram, given the requirements of an information system. ●To learn how to explain the requirements of an information system, in a model that enables a software engineer to understand the capabilities of the system. ●To learn how to design an information system and rationalize said design in a manner that enables a software engineer to implement the design in a relational database system. ●To learn how to apply the practice of information modeling in a situation similar to those seen in the industry. ●To learn how to work within a team to resolve conflicts and accommodate varied design choices This is a team assignment and is ideally done in a team of 3 or 4 students.]]></summary>

                                    <div class="element-text">As a software engineer, you will often be required to design information systems based on a client’s requirements. It is your responsibility to understand the needs behind the information system and develop a feature set based on the needs. Once you have captured the feature set, you will often be responsible for designing an information system that has the ability to store the required data in an efficient manner without any duplication.<br />
<br />
 The ER diagram is an industry standard and provides a visual representation of the database design. The ER diagram is the focal point of communication with the client and should be  easy to read, modify and capture all the constraints to be represented in the database.<br />
<br />
A critical ability while working within a team is to develop an ability to manage conflicts, accommodate different design decisions, and manage conflicting client requirements. This milestone helps you learn and apply these abilities in a real life situation.<br />

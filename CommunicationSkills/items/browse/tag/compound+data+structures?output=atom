  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

                                    <div class="element-text">This assignment explores an approach to searching and replacing data in a text file motivated by the following situation. Suppose that the only strings you are allowed to replace are words, contiguous strings with no embedded spaces or punctuation.<br />
<br />
A situation like this might occur if you want to rename variables in a program. The other feature of this situation is that the file on which search and replace is to be done could be huge while the number of distinct words is small. And a large number of search and replace operations will be done as a single batch. Imagine a long list of updates to a large piece of software.<br />
<br />
The team design and presentation aspect of this assignment is typical in the project planning phase of software development. A requirements engineer might propose a new feature (in this case word search/replace). The developers and testers need to communicate about designs that will incorporate the new feature.  A test plan is a critical aspect of the communication between a requirements engineer and the designer. It ensures that each understands the expected behavior of the software under a variety of circumstances.</div>

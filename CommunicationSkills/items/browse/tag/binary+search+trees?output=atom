  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <title><![CDATA[Animal Guessing Game with a Binary Search Tree]]></title>
    <summary><![CDATA[A binary search tree is a data structure that is used to handle simple decisions.  In this assignment you will use a binary search tree to store information and then search through the information for a decision.  While a binary search tree is typically for small databases, it is still a potential data structure for many applications, as well as aiding in the understanding of trees (a popular data structure) in general. Decision trees (a more specific type of tree), is commonly used in machine learning and data mining for making intelligent decisions.  The objectives of this assignment are to (1) gain experience researching for a solution to a problem, (2) design a binary search tree (BST) class, (3) design and implement the building of a BST, as well as the methods to add to and search in a BST, and (4) improve written skills through the implementation of proper coding styles and documentation.<br />
<br />
This assignment should be late in the semester, as the students will need to use many aspects of what they have learned over the semester to determine the proper data structures.]]></summary>

Technical Task: In order to learn technical material, one must be able to decipher key concepts through reading.<br />
Professional Setting: Student works for a software company.<br />
Professional Role: Student works along on a task for a project.<br />
Deliverable: Design decisions discussed in design document.<br />
Real-world Audience: Team Lead.<br />
How the Audience will USE the students&#039; communication: The Team Lead will use the student&#039;s design decision(s) to determine the feasibility of their proposed solution.<br />
Additional Notes: Of course, the reading of technical material is not like reading a novel, and one must be able to transfer the pertinent information to a useful form. The two methods of communicating design to others are: speaking and writing. In order for others to digest your intentions, one must learn to effectively write their ideas so that it can be interpreted at the reader’s discretion – either due to remoteness or time.<br />
<br />
<br />
ADDITIONAL SCENARIO:<br />
When working in the real-world, many times you will be presented with a problem or instructions through dialogue with peers or management.  Often, that will be the only instructions you will receive (i.e., nothing in written form).  If you do not listen to what the other person is saying, you may miss a vital piece of information to the success of your assignment. </div>

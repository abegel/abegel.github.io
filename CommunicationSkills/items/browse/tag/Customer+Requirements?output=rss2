The Customer Requirements Report is second of five assignments that prepare students to develop the software they evaluated in the Program Review Report assignment over four two-week scrum cycles.   <br />
<br />
Students perform the following technical tasks: <br />
1.	Teach novice to expert users how to use the software product.<br />
2.	Gather data on user experience including demographic, experience level, and request versus observation.<br />
3.	Analyze data to identify strengths and weaknesses of the software product.<br />
4.	Create a development plan for the program based on analysis of customer experience.<br />
5.	Identify the key technical information about a program that the project manger wants when deciding how to create a development plan to meet customer requirements.<br />

(This is the product your team evaluated in the Product Review Report.) The product manager has assigned your development team to develop customer requirements based on customer experience using the product.  Your team needs to gather data on the experience of novices (someone who rarely used this type of product) and experts (someone who frequently uses this type of product.)  Customer experience may be influenced by factors such as age and gender; therefore, demographic data is important for the product manager.  Customers may or may not be able to articulate their experience. Your team needs to gather data directly from customers with a questionnaire, for example, and by observing customers using the product. Your team’s report needs to make recommendations for developing the product to meet customer needs. The project manager has asked your team to make a ten-minute presentation summarizing the report. Your team’s evaluation report and presentation provides the project manager with critical information to plan how to develop the product. YOUR DELIVERABLES 1. The project manager has asked your team to prepare a three-to-five-page requirements report. 2. The project manager has asked your team to present significant findings from the requirements report in a ten-to-fifteen-minute meeting. WHAT YOUR READER WILL DO WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS YOU PROVIDE The manager must develop a plan for completing the project. Therefore, the manager wants your team to answer the following technical questions: 1. How usable is the product for novice and expert users? 2. What factors affect the user’s ability to use the product? 3. What are the most significant factors that affect user’s ability to use the product? You must provide answers to these questions in a manner that helps the manager develop a plan. The manager must evaluate your team to determine whether it is capable of completing the project. The manager will use your team’s report to answer the following questions: 1. Can your team teach novice to expert users how to use the product? 2. Can your team gather useful data on user experience with the product? 3. Can your team identify significant factors that affect user experience? 4. Are you and the other team members able to work together effectively? You need to present your information in a way that persuades the manager that your team is technically proficient and effective at collaborating on a complex project.<br />

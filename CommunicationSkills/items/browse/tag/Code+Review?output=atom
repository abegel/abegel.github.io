  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <summary><![CDATA[This assignment allows presenters the opportunity to orally summarize the state of their team&#039;s project at the time of the presentation and the report should give the audience a low-level and technical look at the details of the team&#039;s design and implementation.  Student team is required to give a copy of their team’s documentation to another team for review.  Team will critique another team&#039;s project documentation/presentation.  During the question and answer period of the formal oral presentation, each member of the critiquing team is expected to ask a probing question of the team that just presented their project.]]></summary>

  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <title><![CDATA[Black Box Test Plan - Bug Hunt]]></title>
    <summary><![CDATA[This assignment is the first in a series of black box testing assignments that can be used in CS1/CS2 level classes. The assignment is to have students write and run black box test cases for a given application.  The students are given the requirements and a compiled version of the program with seeded bugs.  The students are evaluated on the tests they write, the bugs they find, and their summary of bug information for a developer.<br />

Black box testing is typically done late in the development lifecycle, after a large portion of the functionality of a product is to be delivered.  To ensure product quality, you will want to test your product using the product’s requirements as a guide.  Additionally, you will want to report the results of your testing to the development team.<br />
<br />
You may not always be in the same position as product tester, so you will want to ensure that your test cases can be run by your co-workers on future versions of the product.<br />

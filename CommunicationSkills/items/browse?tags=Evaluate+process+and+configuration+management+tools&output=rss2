                                    <div class="element-text">CSC 225 – Introduction to Software Development PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOLS REPORT The project manager has decided to continue development of the product begun but not completed by an acquired company. (This is the product your team evaluated in the Product Review Report, developed customer requirements for in the Customer Requirements Report, and developed a prioritized bug/enhancement list for in the Prioritized Bug/Enhancement Report.) The product manager has assigned your development team to select and implement project management tools. Specifically, the project manager wants your team’s recommendation on the following:  Process management tool (i.e., a tool to manage the development process)  Configuration management tool (i.e., a tool to manage the product code) Your team’s report needs to recommend tools that your team will use to effectively and efficiently manage product development. The project manager has asked your team to make a ten-minute presentation summarizing the report. Your team’s report and presentation provides the project manager with critical information to plan how to develop the product. YOUR DELIVERABLES 1. The project manager has asked your team to prepare a three-to-five-page project management tools report. 2. The project manager has asked your team to present significant findings from the project management tools report in a ten-to-fifteen-minute meeting. WHAT YOUR READER WILL DO WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS YOU PROVIDE The manager must develop a plan for completing the project. Therefore, the manager wants your team to answer the following technical questions: 1. What process management tool is best suited to manage the development process? 2. What configuration management tool is best suited to manage the development process? 3. What resources are needed to implement and maintain the recommended project management tools? You must provide answers to these questions in a manner that helps the manager develop a plan. The manager must evaluate your team to determine whether it is capable of completing the project. The manager will use your team’s report to answer the following questions: 1. Can your team evaluate and select project management tools? 2. Can your team implement and maintain project management tools? 3. Can your team document tool installation and maintenance for new team members? 4. Are you and the other team members able to work together effectively? You need to present your information in a way that persuades the manager that your team is technically proficient and effective at collaborating on a complex project. LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT While working on this assignment, focus on developing your ability to perform these technical tasks: 1. Evaluate key features of process management tools for a development project. 1<br />

<br />
Over the course there are five set-up assignments<br />
•	Program Review Report<br />
•	Customer Requirements Report<br />
•	Prioritized Bug/Enhancement Report<br />
•	Project Management Tools Report<br />
•	Preliminary Test Plan Report<br />
that provide background for four two-week Scrum Cycles included in the Scrum Process Management assignment.<br />

Each assignment is a specific Technical Rubric.  <br />
<br />
The Communication Skills Rubric is the same for all six assignments.  Communication skills are assessed cumulatively from the rubric.  Communication skills that are to be assessed in this assignment are in red.  Communication skills assessed on in earlier assignments and that will continue to be assess in this assignment are in green.   Communication skills not assess are in black.  All communication skills are assessed for the Scrum Process Management assignment.<br />

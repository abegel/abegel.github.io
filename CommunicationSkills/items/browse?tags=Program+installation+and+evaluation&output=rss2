The Program Review Report is first of five assignments that prepare students to develop the software they evaluate in this assignment over four two-week scrum cycles.  <br />
<br />
Students perform the following technical tasks: <br />
1.	Evaluate installation of existing project software.<br />
2.	Analyze operation of the program.<br />
3.	Identify, describe, and test (reproduce) bugs.<br />
4.	Analyze documentation to determine each document’s purpose, accuracy, and usefulness.<br />
5.	Create a development plan for a program based on evaluations of its installation, operation, bugs, and documentation.<br />
6.	Identify the key technical information about a program that the project manager wants when deciding how to create a development plan with an incomplete project.<br />

The project manager has assigned your development team to evaluate one of the projects that was begun but not completed by the acquired company. Your evaluation report will include recommendations for completing the project. The project manager has asked your team to make a tenminute presentation summarizing the report. Your team’s evaluation report and presentation provides the project manager with critical information to plan how to develop the product. YOUR DELIVERABLES 1. The project manager has asked your team to prepare a five-to-seven-page evaluation report. 2. The project manager has asked your team to present significant findings from the evaluation report in a ten-minute meeting. WHAT YOUR READER WILL DO WITH THE COMMUNICATIONS YOU PROVIDE The manager must develop a plan for completing the project. Therefore, the manager wants your team to answer the following technical questions: 1. Does the program run? 2. What does the program do? 3. What is the current state of the program? 4. What is the current state of the project documentation? 5. What needs to be done to complete the project? You must provide answers to these questions in a manner that helps the manager develop a plan. The manager must evaluate your team to determine whether it is capable of completing the project. The manager will use your team’s report to answer the following questions: 1. Can your team correctly install the program? 2. Can your team identify and correct all incomplete and incorrect aspects of the program? 3. Are you and the other team members able to work together effectively? You need to present your information in a way that persuades the manager that your team is technically proficient and effective at collaborating on a complex project. LEARNING OBJECTIVES FOR THIS ASSIGNMENT While working on this assignment, focus on developing your ability to perform these technical tasks: 1. Evaluate installation of existing project software. 2. Analyze operation of the program. 3. Identify, describe, and test (reproduce) bugs. 4. Analyze documentation to determine each document’s purpose, accuracy, and usefulness. 5. Create a development plan for a program based on evaluations of its installation, operation, bugs, and documentation. 6. Identify the key technical information about a program that the project manger wants when deciding how to create a development plan with an incomplete project. 1<br />

  <title><![CDATA[Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum]]></title>
  <subtitle><![CDATA[The CPATH-II project is a National Science Foundation funded project under the Division of Computer and Communication Foundation (CCF) that focuses on “Incorporating Communication Outcomes into the Computer Science Curriculum”. The project is a three year project that began in October, 2009 and will culminate at the end of September, 2012. 
<p/>
The dissemination of the project's research will come with the creation of a repository that allows CSE faculty members to access a web-based set of assignments. The goal of these assignments is to aid CSE faculty in redesigning their assignments, courses, and curricula in order to incorporate and enhance their students abilities to communicate and collaborate with a wide variety of audiences. The repository will be populated with assignments written and designed by both CSE and CAC faculty with the premise of integrating communication abilities while also enhancing the learning of the technical content being taught in their course and/or curriculum.

    <title><![CDATA[Understanding and Debugging Someone Else&#039;s Program]]></title>
    <summary><![CDATA[In this assignment, you will be given the code.  However, it was created by someone who is no longer around to answer any questions about the program.  Plus, there are some severe issues with the code – including it won’t even compile.  The objectives for this assignment are to (1) gain experience understanding code, (2) learn proper debugging techniques, and (3) work on writing a technical report.  In this particular example, we used Conway&#039;s &quot;Game of Life&quot;.<br />
<br />
This is an early in the semester assignment, and students should understand basic constructs, pointers, and how to read code.<br />

Technical Task:  When working in the real-world, many times you will be given an existing piece of code that you must understand before you can implement any enhancements or fixes.  And many times, the original developer of the code is no longer available – leaving you to figure out what the code is doing.<br />
Professional Setting:  Students works for a company that has purchased another.<br />
Professional Role:  Students are members of a project team.<br />
Deliverable:  Bug/Enhancement report.<br />
Real-world Audience:  A project manager.<br />
How the Audience will USE the student&#039;s communication:  The project manager will use the students&#039; report to develop a plan for completing the project.<br />

Debugging a program is something that every developer has to do.  Whether for a student or a seasoned software engineer, figuring out what is wrong in a piece of code and fixing the issue is a necessary skill.</div>

<h3>Overview</h3>

<p>Overall, programming in Titanium requires some getting used to. I've programmed in
explicitly parallel environments before, but this language takes a shared-memory
message-passing approach to parallelism instead of a multi-threaded approach (like
StarLogo or Cilk). </p>

<p>Anyway, we designed our Fish Simulation implementation to model the fish on a
distributed grid. Each processor would get a piece of the grid and then would compute the
pseudo-gravity-like force on every fish contained within its own part. After computing the
force, the fish would be moved around on the grid. We also checked for walls and made the
fish bounce off elastically. </p>

<h3>Titanium Implementation</h3>

<h4>Grid</h4>

<p>Titanium doesn't have spread arrays like Split-C, so laying out the grid on P
processors took some finagling. I first implemented a simple one-level quad-tree structure
which allowed me to run with 4 processors. Each processor took one quarter of the grid.
Titanium is a shared-memory language, so there had to exist a globally replicated memory
array of size P that contained pointers to each processor's grid.&nbsp; One this has been
arranged, all grid accesses by any processor are transparently represented, even if the
pointer goes across processors. </p>

<p>However, it would be nice if Titanium supported a Partition class that automatically
would partition a Domain (as in a set of points for the computation) across P processors.
Right now, you may only have a 1-dimensional array of processors instead of an arbitrary
domain. As a first attempt, I created a Split class (partition is a keyword) that could
take in a number of processors and a RectDomain, and divide up the RectDomain evenly
(block-style). The abstraction includes a way to find the processor that owns a particular
point, a way to tell if a point is in a particular processor's domain, and a way to
specify the layout properties (block, cyclic, bands, skew, etc...).</p>

<h4>FishList</h4>

<p>My FishList is a functional-style linked-list class that is specialized for Fish (Java
doesn't have templates yet). This worked fine except for the cases where a read and a
modification to the FishList (it's functional, so it is creating a new FishList and
changing the grid's pointer to the new one) happened at the same time. It takes a few
instructions to remove an element from a list of fish, so naturally, one would like to
lock the data structure, so no one could read it. However, Titanium hasn't yet implemented
the synchronized keyword, causing a few mistakes where some fish would get counted more
than once. </p>

<h4>Fish</h4>

<p>The Fish are a simple class with vectors for velocity and position. They also contain
the algorithms for moving themselves and checking for walls. </p>

<h4>DoubleVector</h4>

<p>This is my DoubleVector class. It's an immutable class (which means that it's
call-by-value, not call-by-reference) that implements a simple 2-dimensional vector of
doubles (Points would be cool to use, but they only do integers). At some point, operator
overloading will work, and using this class will look much more normal than it currently
does (it's functional too). </p>

<h3>Optimization</h3>

<p>Hah! Yeah right. I barely made this thing work in the first place. The code sure does
look purty though. </p>

<h3>Results</h3>

<p>Well, I'm not such a wiz with Excel, so I'll put my numbers in here as a placeholder
until I can get David to make me up some graphs.</p>

<hr>

<p>This is for 500 fish where the grid is partitioned reasonably equally among the P
processors. </p>

<p>I get linear speedup for 1 2 3 4 and 5 and then it starts going down for 6 7 and 8. <br>

The difference between total time and the other two added up is the time spent in
barriers. I'm also seeing some load imbalance, especially on larger numbers of processors.

<h3>Code</h3>

<p>The code is <a href="fishsim.ti">here</a>. </p>

<p align="center">I've got a binary for the clumps in <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~abegel/cs267/fishsim3">here</a>. There are no command
line arguments, due to an annoying feature of Titanium that the argv input isn't
guaranteed by the compiler to be the same across all processors (Even though it is). </p>

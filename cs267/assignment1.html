<h1>Modeling Complex Systems</h1>

<p>I'm interested in using parallel computers to model <a
href="http://complex.csu.edu.au/complex/">complex systems</a>. Modeling relatively static
things like stress on bridges is nice, but I prefer systems that have easily expressible
simple rules, instead of average calculations using differential equations. </p>

<p>I'm also very interesting in biology, more from an ecology point of view than from
molecular biology and protein folding (which for some reason is becoming all the rage).
I'm interested in the evolution of species, ecologies and morphologies (and since a
computer is much faster than the real thing, it's an excellent experimentation platform). </p>

<h2>StarLogo</h2>

<p>I think that parallel agent simulations are pretty cool. I did some work at MIT with
the <a href="http://el.www.media.mit.edu/groups/el">Epistemology and Learning</a> group at
the <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu">Media Lab</a> with <a
href="http://www.media.mit.edu/~starlogo">StarLogo</a>, a parallel programming environment
for kids. It lets kids program thousands of Logo turtles to run around the screen. We've
had kids make simulations of ecological systems (<a

<p>This StarLogo <a href="http://www.media.mit.edu/~starlogo/information/othersites.html">page
</a>has pointers to lots of other agent simulations on the web.</p>

<h3>Commentary</h3>

<p>StarLogo was originally implemented on the CM2 in *Lisp. The CM2 was a SIMD data
parallel system, and StarLogo implemented three types of parallel models on top of it.
Logo turtles were SPMD, Logo patches (the background was a grid of patches) were SIMD, and
the observer was sequential. </p>

<p>While the SIMD and sequential models were a match for the SIMD CM2, SPMD was a little
constrained. On a SIMD computer, all processors execute in lockstep, which made for some
strange turtle behavior. If turtles were looking for food, the turtle that didn't find any
couldn't move until the turtle who had found some picked it up and ate it. </p>

<p>Reimplemented on a set of virtual machines running on a sequential processor allowed us
to make the turtle machine truly SPMD. All of the turtles were free to wander in different
sections of the code at any time, forcing us to rewrite our example problems over again.
:)</p>

<p>StarLogo's problem is scalability. It doesn't scale past one StarLogo world running on
one single computer. Its computing model doesn't allow for hierarchical simulation
structure, nor does it provide the user with a cost model for execution. On a single
computer, this doesn't matter, but implemented on something like a Clump, different worlds
would interact with varying speeds.</p>

<p>At one point I did an experiment to evolve rabbits in an ecosystem. Two computers ran
the ecosystems in famine and plenty modes. After some time, a wormhole was opened between
the two worlds, allowing the rabbits to directly compete with one another. After evolving
to their own world, the invader rabbits from the famine world did better in the plenty
world than vice versa. In addition, the rabbits from the world running on the Mac IIfx did
much worse than the ones on the PowerMac 8100 because the faster computer bred more
rabbits in a shorter time. This was a limited experiment, but given enough computers and
enough power, a large variety of ecologies could be developed and explored. </p>

<h2>Tierra</h2>
<a href="http://www.hip.atr.co.jp/~ray/tierra/tierra.html">

<p>This</a> is one of the most famous Artificial Life programs out there. Created by Tom
Ray at the U. Delaware (now at HIP Research Lab in Japan), it allows people to model
organisms living in a soup. First, you write the genome for an ancestor organism in a
pseudo-assembly language. This organism can find food and reproduce itself by copying.
After filling up the soup with these creatures, you let the simulation go. After some time
and random mutation, you start seeing alternative organisms that made mistakes in copying.
They're very similar to the ancestor. At some point, though, you start to get parasitic
mutants who are much shorter in length, but use assembly code from other normal organisms
to copy themselves! It's really exciting stuff. </p>

<p>Tierra's been implemented on workstations, but was also ported to the CM5 and to a
distributed computing framework. This Network Tierra is really neat because it's able to
model a rapidly mutating distributed ecology with millions of organisms running in
parallel and moving themselves around the network. </p>

Tierra-like systems on the net. </p>

<p>Here's some other similar work that could be adapted to running on parallel computers:</p>

<h2>Swarm</h2>

<p>At the <a href="http://www.santafe.edu">Santa Fe Institute</a>, they've got a project
called <a href="http://www.santafe.edu/projects/swarm">Swarm</a>. This project, from Chris
Langton, is a grown-up version of StarLogo that provies a lot more general, flexible and
customizable environment.</p>

<h2>Sugarscape</h2>

<p>Joshua Epstein and Robert Axtell has applied these types of ideas toward modeling
social systems. &quot;<a href="http://www.brookings.org/SUGARSCAPE">Sugarscape</a>
includes population dynamics, migration, combat, trade, cultural transmission, genetics,
environmental effects, immunology, and epidemiology in a spatially distributed artificial
society of heterogeneous agents with limited information, evolving preferences, and other
recognizably human capabilities and limitations.&quot;</p>

<h2>EcoLab</h2>

<p>This <a href="http://parallel.acsu.unsw.edu.au/rks/ecolab.html">project</a>, by Russell
Standish at UNSW in Australia explores Lotke-Volterra interactions between populations of
organisms.</p>

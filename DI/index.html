<div class="boxtitle">Summary</div>
<div class="boxtext">
<p>Deep Intellisense is a Visual Studio 2008 plugin that surfaces information from various silos (source control, bug tracking, mailing lists, etc.) to provide developers with instant context-sensitive feedback on any source code they are reading in the editor. 
Deep Intellisense works with Visual Studio Team Foundation System projects (such 
as those hosted on CodePlex), email archives (from Outlook) and Sharepoint 
sites.</p>

Deep Intellisense was designed and created by 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~abegel">Andrew Begel</a> and 
<a href="http://pages.cpsc.ucalgary.ca/~rtholmes/">Reid Holmes</a> in the 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com/hip">Human Interactions in Programming</a> group at 
<a href="http://research.microsoft.com">Microsoft Research</a>. Its base infrastructure uses the Bridge 
database, by <a href="http://research.microsoft.com/~ginav">Gina Venolia</a>.</p>

<div class="box">
<div class="boxtitle">Details</div>
<div class="boxtext">
<p>Deep Intellisense is based on the Bridge, a graph of developers and their 
activities like source code checkins, bug database entries, and mailing list 
messages where each entry is linked to another when there is a relationship 
between them. For example, a source code checkin was <em>authored</em> by a 
particular developer. A tester <em>open</em>ed a bug report. A user <em>email</em>ed 
a stack trace from a crash to the recipients of a mailing list. Deep 
Intellisense presents a code-centric view of this graph: for any code entity 
(class, method, field, property) that you click on, it shows the related 
checkins, bugs, mailing list messages, and people discovered through transitive 
two hop graph traversals. </p>
<p>Deep Intellisense presents three views: Current Item, Event History, and 
Related People.</p>
<p>&lt;Screen shot of Current Item View&gt;</p>
<p>The current item view shows the current code entity that is selected in the 
Visual Studio editor. It summarizes the checkin, bug and discussion forum 
messages that are related to the particular code entity. If you clicked on a 
method call, or use of a class or variable, Deep Intellisense may have trouble 
recognizing exactly what the fully qualified name of the entity is (Deep 
Intellisense works at a parse-level, but performs no semantic analysis). In this 
case, it will show a pulldown menu to let you pick from a set of alternatives. A 
button allows you to search for this symbol in MSDN.</p>
<p>&lt;Screen shot of Event History View&gt;</p>
<p>The event history view shows a sorted list of bugs, checkins and discussion 
forum messages that we have discovered are related to the selected code. By 
clicking on the bug title, change set, or message title, you can bring up 
further information. If you click on the associated person&#39;s name, you can email 
them to ask them a question. This view also allows you to dynamically filter the 
entries you see using a word wheel, and lets you sort the entries by date, 
person and event type.</p>
<p>&lt;Screen shot of Related People View&gt;</p>
<p>The related people view pulls out all of the people related to the code and 
lists them in alphabetical order. It shows the number of bugs, checkins and 
forum messages each of them has created about the particular code that is 
selected. In addition, you can click on a person&#39;s name to send him an email 
with a question. There is a little social tagging in Deep Intellisense: if you 
like a person&#39;s checkins or messages and want everyone to pay attention to them, 
clicking on the green thumbs-up icon
<img alt="Thumbs Up" src="MarkRelevant.png" width="16" height="16" /> will 
attach the icon to all events by that person in the event history view. If the 
person is irrelevant to your code investigation, clicking on the red thumbs-down 
icon <img alt="Thumbs Down" src="MarkDiscarded.png" width="16" height="16" /> 
will hide their corresponding events from the event history view. To see these 
hidden events again (and turn off the red thumbs-down icon), click the Show All 
button in the related people or event history view. </p>

<div class="boxtitle">Research</div>
<div class="boxtext">
<p>We built Deep Intellisense to address a number of research findings:</p>
<ol>
	<li>Locating high-level code-related information is very important. 
	Developers frequently want access to design-level information, but find that 
	it is difficult to locate (Ko, DeLine, Venolia 2007)</li>
	<li>Developers rely heavily on implicit knowledge. For example, while a bug 
	and a checkin may both be useful, the implicit link between them (perhaps 
	the bug was fixed by the checkin) is most important. (La Toza, Venolia, 
	DeLine, 2006).</li>
	<li>Developers search through bug and checkin history on a daily basis in 
	some large companies in the Pacific Northwest.</li>
</ol>
<h3>Contextual Inquiry</h3>
<p>We interviewed 3 developers and 2 testers to better understand how they 
performed their daily tasks. We focused on specific tools and techniques that 
enabled them to get their jobs done. </p>
<ul>
	<li>Tester #1: Hotfix tester. Is given a bug and a diff by a developer. As 
	such he knows exactly what was changed and who to talk to. </li>
	<li>Tester #2: Performance tester. Investigates a lot of code to figure out 
	where to put tracing markers. </li>
	<li>Developer #1: Dev lead. Spends 70% of his time looking at code written 
	by other developers. Lots of source code control command-line work. </li>
	<li>Developer #2: 50% of time is reading code. Lots of bug database 
	searching, works hard to find the diffs associated with a bug. </li>
	<li>Developer #3: Team is mostly new but working on an older product. 
	Specifics of a change aren’t interesting but knowing there has been one is.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>During these interviews several common themes emerged between the SDETs and 
the SDEs: </p>
<ul>
	<li>&quot;What happened most recently?&quot; Recency was a recurring trend in the 
	comments, both developers and tersters wanted to consider the information 
	available to them in reverse-chronological order. </li>
	<li>&quot;Who should I contact about this?&quot; If, after looking through bug and 
	change history, the developer decided to follow up with someone from an 
	external team identifying the correct contact person was important. Who they 
	talked to depended on the type of information they wanted: it could be the 
	person who closed the bug, opened it, made a comment in it, made the 
	check-in, or created the spec associated with the code. </li>
	<li>&quot;How can I filter the information available to me&quot; Both testers and 
	developers had an overabundance of information available to them. They 
	wanted to filter first to find that information that is relevant to the code 
	they are investigating and then filter further to find information that is 
	relevant to the aspect of the code they are considering. Providing a 
	flexible way to access the information they required was very important.
	</li>
</ul>
<p>Interestingly, we also found two pieces of information that was not 
interesting to either group: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Burstiness: There was little interesting the density of changes. For 
	example, if there were 4 check-ins in two days and nothing until 2 months 
	later, that was not an interesting fact developers cared about. </li>
	<li>Relationship to product schedule: While the strict ordering of events 
	(this check-in before that one, or this bug opened before that check-in was 
	made) was interesting, how these events related to the product schedule 
	(e.g., was this check-in before milestone 3?) was not interesting to these 
	developers. </li>
</ul>
<p>In addition to the commonalities between developers and testers, we also 
found that they had some role-specific qualities: </p>
<ul>
	<li>Developers investigate a large amount source code they did not write 
	themselves.
	<ul>
		<li>Frequently try to infer how a bug relates to a check-in (or vice 
		versa). This is similar to the point in the background material about 
		the value of inferred information. By relating a bug to a check-in the 
		developer can see both <em>what</em> was changed (from the diff in the 
		check-in) and get some idea as to <em>why</em> it was changed (by 
		looking at the associated bug). </li>
		<li>Developers are often trying to answer &quot;Am I wrong or are they?&quot; By 
		this, the developer is trying to determine if external code is behaving 
		the way it should (and they should fix their own code) or if they need 
		to contact the owner of the external code to have them make a change to 
		their code. </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
	<li>Testers work on tasks for specific people.
	<ul>
		<li>Testers are often assigned a bug, and given a diff, by a specific 
		developer. From this they have an explicit point of contact for any 
		questions. At the same time, they are still interested in seeing if the 
		bug they are testing (or its associated check-in) is related to any 
		other similar bugs and check-ins for a particular piece of code. </li>
		<li>Testers spend a lot of time looking at particular details in bugs 
		and investigating specific diffs (to determine what exactly needs to be 
		tested). </li>
	</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<h3>Prototype Development</h3>
<p>After interviewing each developer about their work practice, we provided them 
with a series of low-fidelity mockups of Deep Intellisense. The intent of this 
exercise was to focus our development effort on providing information that is 
relevant to developers and testers, in a format that is usable to them, as they 
undertake their daily activities. After seeing how they responded to the 
mockups, we settled on three main design goals for Deep Intellisense: <!--In the scenario above, locating the right bug and change involved repeated usages and queries of both <code>sd</code> and <code>Product Studio</code>. These two tools involve different interfaces and do not talk to one and other directly even though they have common attributes between them (bugs in Product Studio are fixed by changes recorded in Source Depot (and vice versa)). After talking to developers we had three main goals while desigining Deep Intellisense: -->
</p>
<ol>
	<li>Provide context-relevant historical code information. </li>
	<li>Work with the developer&#39;s existing environment. </li>
	<li>Link directly to tools developers are familiar with. </li>
</ol>
<p>By context-relevant we mean that instead of always providing file-level 
granularity for a particular change, Deep Intellisense should provide listings 
of only those changes that affected the class, field, or method of interest. We 
chose to work within the developer&#39;s current environment because developers 
already have an overwhelming number of independent tools at their fingertips; we 
didn&#39;t want to exacerbate this situation. We chose not to try to replicate 
existing tools (notably source code control, bug database and diff tools) as 
developers are already familiar with these; instead we focused on making 
interactions with these tools more effective. </p>

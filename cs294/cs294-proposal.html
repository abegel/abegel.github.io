<h3>Problem</h3>

The MASH Media Board allows people to write and draw onto a
shared workspace that every person in a video conferencing session can
access. However, it provides us with only a limited palette since any
information presented must be copied into it from the application
where we developed the material. Since the goal of presenting
information is to prepare it once and show it to everyone, this act of
copying inevitably degrades the quality of the information. For
example, MB can't display multiple fonts, doesn't handle line
wrapping, and doesn't support easy importation of graphics, which are
all the things that make or break a presentation. As an annotation
tool, the MB is great because anyone can write something at any time
or illustrate a point by drawing a circle around something.<p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

I'd like to combine the good qualities of annotation with a direct
manipulation style of information presentation. I'd like to create a
"network lens" that would ride on top of any particular display and
would transmit its data to other people in the session. In addition,
the tool would support annotation tools, like text writing and drawing
on top of the display. This way, if you need to present something from
Netscape, you can just move the lens over Netscape, and start
talking. You could illustrate points by circling things in the lens
and these updates would be transferred to the audience. The final
concept is something similar to a Media Board application with a
transparent background.<p>


<h3>Suggested Design</h3>

There have been some designs for "magic lenses" in the
past. These lenses have been typically used to scale images (magnify
images for people with bad vision), but they have also been used to
filter information. A group of researchers at U. Toronto, U. Washington and Xerox PARC
created this new style of see-through interface with
Toolglass and Magic Lenses in 1993. They created lenses of arbitrary
size and shape that could be used on a display to filter
information. For example, they had a fractal lens, which fractalized
any image it was passed over. They had a magnification lens that
magnified what was under it. There were color shift filters, symmetry
filters, information annotation filters, etc. <p>


This application would be similar to these magic lenses, but
would transmit its "vision" over an RTP multicast network to many
people. Presumably this could use the scalable reliable multicast
protocol created by Steve McCanne and Teck-Lee Tung. In addition,
drawing and writing tools would be added, a la Media Board, to allow
the user to annotate the vision.<p>


I envision this to be a minimalist application. One would only
need a small palette of tools, a display lens, and a context switching
button (allowing the user to click "through" the transparency to the
applications below). It is advantagous to let the user manipulate
the actual computer stuff underneath the drawing surface. Toolglass
invented transparent buttons that would allow mouse clicks to "pass"
through to the application beneath them. While this is a nice goal, a
more reasonable approach would be to make this system exist in two
modes, one where you could manipulate the computer underneath the
lens, and another where you could draw and write on top of the lens.<p>


I would like to implement this in Tcl/Tk/X Windows (as I don't have a PC
handy, nor do I want to figure out the entire Win32 API in a month). I
can borrow ideas from Xeyes (which has a transparent window and draws
stuff on top of it) and wscrawl, a program which implements a simple
whiteboard. Once these two features are integrated, all that would
remain would be to attach it to some network protocol (either X or
SRM) to transmit the info to everyone's screens. <p>


<h3>Experiment</h3>

A complex user study involving hundreds of users and hetergenous
working environments would be great, but realistically, in four weeks,
I might be able to test this once in the CoLab during a class. I'd
envision using the LiveBoard in BSD UNIX mode to run the app and have
remote people running the client instead of Media Board.<p>

I anticipate several UI issues which would be brought out by
using the application. What kind of palette should be used? How can it
be attached to the drawing layer without getting in the way? How will
users control what is sent over the network? What happens if the
underlying screen is undergoing animation? What will happen to any
drawings that are on top of it? What happens when the user moves the
underlying application (let's say Netscape) over to the left 10
pixels. Does the drawing layer move? Perhaps it should be movable by
the user? Or scrollable? All these design decisions could be easily
decided with a small prototype.<p>

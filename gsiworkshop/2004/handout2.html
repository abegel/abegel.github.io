What is the job of a GSI?</h2>		<p>Discuss.</p>		<h2>Fears and Preparations Exercise</h2>		<ul type=disc>			<li>Break into small groups of 3-4 people.			<li>Each group should introduce themselves to one another again, briefly.			<li>Each person should talk about their favorite teacher of all time, and mention one of the things that the teacher did to make them so memorable.			<li>Each group is given an index card.			<ul type=DISC>				<li>On one side, write down three things that you all are planning to do to prepare to teach before the semester begins.				<li>On the other side, write down three things that you are most afraid will happen in the classrooms			</ul>			<li>Reconvene, summarize lists, draw connections			<li>Go over other fears and ask for suggestions for alleviating them from the groups		</ul>		<h2>Mechanics of Teaching Section</h2>		<ul>			<h3>				<li>Your first section			</h3>			<ul type=CIRCLE>				<li>Your introduction				<li>Their introductions				<li>Intro to the course				<li>Talk about how you want to run section				<ul type=CIRCLE>					<li>Can homework be late?

How much?					<li>How fast will you respond to e-mail?					<li>Do you have rules for participating in section?				</ul>				<li>Get their info on index cards (get index cards from department front desk)				<ul type=CIRCLE>					<li>Name					<li>Email address					<li>Year					<li>Experience					<li>Major					<li>Web page					<li>Project partners (if relevant)				</ul>				<li>If you've got a digital camera, take everyone's picture (ask for permission first).				<ul type=CIRCLE>					<li>Write down the people's names on a list in the same order that you take their picture.					<li>This is a <b>HUGE</b> help in putting names to faces.				</ul>				<li>Schedule office hours				<ul type=CIRCLE>					<li>Draw up a list of times and ask students which ones they can make it to					<li>Select two or three to actually hold each week					<li>It's a good idea to recheck the validity of the times a few weeks into the course, as many students will have changed their schedules.				</ul>				<li>Ask the students about their expectations of the course				<li>Make a class home page to foster community (if the students OK it, put their names and photos on the web page as well! (and/or make it password protected with a .htaccess file)).				<li>Whenever a student speaks, make him say his name. That will help you learn who these people are.			</ul>			<h3>				<li>Office hours			</h3>			<ul>				<li>You can do a lot in office hours				<li>Where do you hold them?				<ul>					<li>Your office, so students can always find you					<ul>						<li>Ask your officemates if this is ok first. Having so many students around can annoy them.					</ul>					<li>Somewhere else, so they can't					<li>In the lab, so you can help all the students				</ul>				<li>If you have one or two students, you can give them plenty of individual attention				<li>If you have a small group, you can run it like a small section or an informal review session				<li>Some shy students won't go to office hours when other people might be there				<ul>					<li>If you have shy students, you could offer them one-on-one tutoring outside office hours (if you have the time)					<li>You could also make an office hour appointment-only				</ul>			</ul>			<h3>				<li>The value of the wrong answer			</h3>			<ul>				<li>It's OK for students to be wrong in section or office hours or lab				<ul>					<li>That's why we have more than just lecture					<li>A wrong answer can be a learning experience					<li>Unfortunately, most students and many GSIs don't realize this				</ul>				<li>If you are in office hours or lab, let the student run with the wrong idea for a while.				<li>If you are in section, you might not want it to go on quite as long.				<li>At some point, the student should see a problem with his or her work.				<ul>					<li>That's where you come in					<li>Help students see what is wrong					<li>Help them work their way back to the error				</ul>				<li>If the student doesn't see the mistake, or if you can't wait that long, don't point out the actual error.				<ul>					<li>Saying something like &quot;You forgot to initialize that variable&quot; might save you a few minutes, but it doesn't help the student					<li>Try to get the student to see some unwanted consequence of that mistake				</ul>				<li>Try making a mistake in what you say. See how long it takes for the students to catch it.				<li>You're walking a fine line between making a few mistakes and appearing stupid.

Talk to them as soon as possible				<li>If your students work in groups, make sure the groups are healthy				<ul>					<li>Sometimes one student gets by without doing any work					<li>Sometimes friends learn the material together but can't work individually					<li>Sometimes group members dislike each other				</ul>				<li>Does one of your students seem to have some sort of learning disability or testing anxiety? Check out the Disabled Students Program (<a href="http://dsp.berkeley.edu"><tt>http://dsp.berkeley.edu</tt></a>)				<li>If your students trust you, they might tell you their problems				<ul>					<li>Be prepared to listen - this is actually quite an honor					<li>You are probably not a qualified therapist, though					<li>If their problems sound serious, refer them to Counseling and Mental Health Services (<a href="http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/Students/Counseling/"><tt>http://www.uhs.berkeley.edu/Students/Counseling/</tt></a>)				</ul>			</ul>			<h3>				<li>Motivating your students			</h3>			<ul>				<li>Things that kill motivation include:				<ul>					<li>Low grades on midterms					<li>Fear of low grades on midterms					<li>Bad professors					<li>Bad books					<li>Bad GSIs					<li>Not wanting to be in the class					<li>Dry, theoretical material					<li>Material that isn't challenging enough					<li>The EECS environment				</ul>				<li>Things that you can do to help:				<ul>					<li>Counteract a bad professor or book by being friendly, helpful, and available					<li>Be willing to listen to students when they have problems					<ul>						<li>Research indicates that students are more willing to ask for academic help when they think teachers care about them as people						<li>Office hours may not always be the way to help students, so be willing to set up special appointments					</ul>					<li>Make things more fun					<ul>						<li>you can usually get away with some jokes						<li>sometimes the department will pay for candy						<li>give interesting examples, not just &quot;foo&quot; and &quot;bar&quot;						<li>don't use words when pictures will do					</ul>					<li>If the professor discusses theory, discuss applications					<li>If the professor discusses applications, discuss theory					<li>Emphasize learning, not grades					<ul>						<li>Students who want to learn the material so they can show people they get it don't learn as well and don't ask for help						<li>Students who want to learn the material so they can understand it learn better and ask for help when they need it						<li>Together, you and the professor have a little bit of influence on why students want to learn					</ul>				</ul>			</ul>			<h3>				<li>Reflection			</h3>			<ul type=circle>				<li>How are you doing?				<li>Tape your section and go over it with other TAs or prof				<li>Have another TA or prof visit your section and give you feedback				<li>Keep track of how many students come to section and how they do				<li>What could you be doing better?				<li>Does class time fly by or drag on?				<li>Keep a journal or teacher's portfolio of everything you use for class				<li>Read over all your lesson plans and emails				<li>Review how things went in the first section so you can make adjustments your second section.			</ul>			<h3>				<li>Overall GSI tips			</h3>			<ul>				<li>Listen to your students!				<ul type=CIRCLE>					<li>Corollary: Learn their names -- it comes in handy later on.				</ul>				<li>Practice makes perfect				<li>Make your students do all the hard work				<li>An ounce of preparation is worth a pound of flimflam				<li>Determine your availability. Create boundaries!				<li><b>NEVER</b> give out your phone number or instant messenger account name.				<li>Avoid GSI burnout. You don't need to be the superhero <i>every</i> week. 				<li>Know your resources				<li>You are a paid employee. The professor and the students are your bosses. Make sure you respect your responsibility and don't let your bosses down.				<li><b><i>You</i></b> are <b>not</b> average.				<ul>					<li>You are a graduate student in one of the best universities in the country. Many of your students won't get this far.				</ul>			</ul>		</ul>		<h2>Timing</h2>		<p>Close your eyes for one minute, then open them. Notice how a minute is much longer than it seems. Give your students time to answer you questions. After asking, wait at least 30 seconds for people to answer the problem. Given that you know the subject <i>and</i> the answer to your question, and they know neither, they're going to need some non-trivial amount of time to figure it out.</p>		<h2>Tact and Sensitivity Discussion</h2>		<p>You are an authority figure whose words have significant impact on your students. If a students asks a &quot;dumb&quot; question, remind yourself that this student would not ask this question unless they did not understand the material, which should make you worry about the effectiveness of the course.</p>		<p>In this exercise, we'll come up with a list of words that could potentially be damaging psychologically to your students. As we come up with each, we'll discuss a situation in which it might arise and brainstorm tactful ways to resolve it.</p>		<h2>CS301/EE301</h2>		<ul>			<li>As first-time GSIs, all of you are required to sign up for CS301 (Computer Science) or EE301 (Electrical Engineering).			<li>The web site for this Computer Science version of this course is at <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs301">http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs301</a>.

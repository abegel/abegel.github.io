<H3>Introduction to the morning</H3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<li>Vocabulary
		<UL TYPE=DISC>
		<LI>GSI = TA
		<li>GSR = RA
		<li>Berkeley Time = 10 minutes after the hour
		</UL>
	<LI>Welcome, my background
	<UL TYPE=DISC>
		<LI>Andy Begel (pronunciation guide: Bay-gull, Bee-ge'll, Beagle)
		<li>GSId twice before (CS61a, CS164)
		<li>MIT Undergraduate ('96, '97)
		<li>Programming Languages
	</UL>
	<li>Why are we all here?
	<UL TYPE=DISC>
		<LI>GSIs are critical to undergraduate education
		<li>The University wants GSIs to succeed
	</UL>	
</UL>

<h3>Activity! <FONT SIZE="-2">(Activities are fun!)</FONT></h3> 

<p>Each GSI will come up to the front of the room and introduce him or herself to the rest of the group, in the style of a GSI's first introduction to their students at their first section. Maximum 1 minute per person.</p>

<h3>Continuum Activity!</h3>

<p>GSIs will stand up and position themselves along a continuum whose boundaries are given below, one at a time:</p>
<OL TYPE="1" START="1">
	<LI>Experience Teaching: A lot / A little
	<li>Desire to Teach: Raring to go / Being forced to TA
	<li>Career: Research / Industry
	<li>Favorite Computer: Macintosh / Windows / Unix
</OL>

<h3>What makes a good GSI?</h3>

<p>GSIs can think back to their favorite GSIs or professors and give examples of how they were good or made their classroom better than the others. We'll write the examples on the board as reference points for the activities to come.</p>

<p>Conversely, we can also discuss what makes a bad GSI. What does a GSI have to do to make students stay away?</p>

<h3>Fears and Preparations Exercise</h3>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Break into small groups of 4-5 GSIs
	<li>Each group should introduce themselves to one another again, briefly
	<li>Each group is given an index card.
	<UL TYPE=DISC>
		<LI>On one side, write down two things that they are planning to do to prepare to teach before the semester begins.
		<li>On the other side, write down three things that they are most afraid will happen in the classrooms 
	</UL>
	<li>Reconvene, summarize lists, draw connections
	<li>Go over other fears and ask for suggestions from the groups
</UL>


<h3>GSI Essentials</h3>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>

	</UL>
	<li>Practice makes perfect
	<li>Make your students do all the hard work
	<li>An ounce of preparation is worth a pound of flimflam
	<li>Determine your availability
	<li>Know your resources
	<li>You are not *average*. (You are a graduate student in one of the best universities in the country. Many of your students won't get this far). 
</UL>

<h3>What are your responsibilities?</h3>

<h3>Tact and Sensitivity Discussion</h3>

<p>You are an authority figure whose words have significant impact on your students. If a students asks a "dumb" question, remind yourself that this student would not ask this question unless they did not understand the material, which should make you worry about the effectiveness of the course.</p>

<p>In this exercise, we'll come up with a list of words that could potentially be damaging psychologically to your students. As we come up with each, we'll discuss a situation in which it might arise and brainstorm tactful ways to resolve it. </p>

		<LI>In CS, this can be boring.
		<li>Watch over your class and ask each group questions proactively.
		<li>Notice students who are in trouble and slow-going.
		<li>NEVER drive the computer/equipment for a student (unless it's to fix something that is totally irrelevant to the class that the student will never ever need to know or see again.)
		<li>Ditto.
	</UL>
	<li>Office Hours
		<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>

			<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
				<LI>Few students: personal instruction, one on one
				<li>More students: mini-recitation-style
				<li>Many students (like before a test): move to a bigger room, essentially do a recitation (but find out what they want to hear about (usually <i>everything</i>.
			</UL>

		</UL>
	</UL>	
</ul>
	
<h3>Time management activity</h3>

<p>Let's discuss the availability issue. In groups of 4-5 GSIs discuss these modes of communications with your students: section, office hours, labs, email, newsgroups, instant messenger, web page announcements, and phone. Write down how many hours per week each mode would take up, and predict how much of each per week it will take to be overwhelming. Is it different for different modes? Why?</p>

<p>Also, try to think about GSI Burnout. Berkeley's terms are 15-16 weeks long. There are very few vacations. It's real easy to suffer burnout towards the end of the term. But this is when your students need you most! Let's discuss ways to rejuvenate yourself at the end of the term.</p>

<h3>Reflection</h3>

<ul type=circle>
	<li>How are you doing?
	<li>Tape your section and go over it with other TAs or prof
	<li>Have another TA or prof visit your section and give you feedback
	<li>Keep track of how many students come to section and how they do
	<li>What could you be doing better?
	<li>Does class time fly by or drag on?
	<li>Keep a journal or teacher's portfolio of everything you use for class
	<li>Read over all your lesson plans and emails
	<li>Review how things went in the first section so you can make adjustments your second section.
</ul>

<h3>Your first section</h3>
<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
	<LI>Your introduction
	<li>Their introductions
	<li>Intro to the course
	<li>Talk about how you want to run section
	<li>Get their info on index cards
		<UL TYPE=CIRCLE>
		<LI>Name
		<li>Email address
		<li>Year
		<li>Experience
		<li>Major
		<li>Web page
		<li>Project partners (if relevant)
		</UL>
	<li>Schedule office hours
	<li>Ask the students about their expectations of the course
	<li>Make a class home page
</UL>

<h3>Department Resources</h3>
<ul type=circle>
	<li>In CS: Brian Harvey, Mike Clancy, Dan Garcia
	<li>Other TAs
	<li>Your research advisor
	<li>EECS 301/302
	<li>GSI Teaching and Resource Center (301 Sproul)
	<li>Barbara Davis: <i>Tools for Teaching</i>
	<li>In CS: Michael David-Sasson (msasson@cs.berkeley.edu). He schedules the rooms. You can move your class to Soda if you talk to him before the term begins!
</ul>

<h3>Creativity Exercise</h3>

<p>Everyone should think about creative ways to hold class. Remember, not every class has to be a traditional lecture-style section.</p>

<h2>Homework</h2>

<p>To give you guys a little flavor of teaching, each GSI will spend 5 minutes after lunch giving a practice teaching talk. Your task is to teach the rest of us about any topic that you like. If you like, you may teach us a small concept about computer science or electrical engineering, but be aware that not everyone in the room has the background that you have (or would like them to have). If you're having trouble thinking of a good topic, perhaps teach us some form of physical activity, or  how to play a game or solve a puzzle. Teach us an interesting dance step, how to play a children's game like duck duck goose (or if you're from Minnesota, duck duck gray duck). Engaging your "class" is essential.</p>

<p>We will follow up each talk with some constructive criticism.</p>

I admire Amy because she knows how to believe in herself and offer alittle bit of that feeling to everyone she knows. I&#8217;d also like to thankFred Martin for four great years of fun and toys. You&#8217;ve created thegadgets that inspired a lot of my work. You were also a great help refining myideas for this thesis. I&#8217;d like to thank Marina Umaschi for her largecollection of useful papers and for being a great sounding board for the ideasin this thesis. Thank you to Vanessa Stevens and Rick Borovoy for always beingaround to answer my questions and always helping out with all of my research.Thanks to Kwin Kramer for all of your technical knowledge. I&#8217;m impressedwith the progress you&#8217;ve made over the past year, and yes, I like yournew computational beads. Really. Thank you to Paula Hooper, Aaron Brandes,David Shaffer, Mike Travers, and David Cavallo for listening and answering myrandom questions for the past few years. Florence Williams, with her quick wit,gave me a smile every time I saw her. That, and a little bit of work to do.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>I&#8217;d like to thank David Feinberg and Carlos Mochon,my good friends and faithful StarLogo UROPs.

In the Epistemology andLearning Group at the MIT Media Laboratory, there has always been a strongemphasis on children as designers of their own projects. This group developsnew technological tools for learning. Constructionism, developed by SeymourPapert, is the guiding philosophy for this research (Papert, 1980, 1993, 1996).Constructionism describes both a theory of learning and a strategy foreducation. As a theory, constructionism is based on the constructivist theoriesof Jean Piaget, the Swiss psychologist who studied learning in young children.Piaget argued that children construct their own knowledge during learning;knowledge is not simply transferred from one person to another. Papert expandson this idea by stating that one particularly good way to construct newknowledge is to construct tangible objects that a child can reflect upon andshare with others (Kafai and Resnick, 1996).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In this chapter, I will explore several underlyingmotivations for enabling kids to build their own games on the Internet.&#8220;Why Construction Kits?&#8221; makes the argument that construction kitsare important to provide design opportunities for children. &#8220;WhyGames?&#8221; argues that games are in the &#8220;kid culture&#8221; and arepersonally meaningful to children.

A growing number ofresearchers have stated that design activities provide great opportunities forlearning. Mitchel Resnick and Natalie Rusk, co-founders of the ComputerClubhouse in Boston (Resnick and Rusk, 1996), have compiled a list of reasonsfor this interest in design-oriented learning:</p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>&middot;</span>Design activities engage youth as <i>activeparticipants</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, giving them a greater senseof control (and responsibility) over the learning process, in contrast totraditional school activities in which teachers aim to &#8220;transmit&#8221;new information to the students.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>&middot;</span>Design activities encourage <i>creativeproblem solving</i><span style='font-style:normal'> avoiding the right vs.wrong dichotomy prevalent in most school mathematics and science activities,suggesting instead that multiple strategies and solutions are possible.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>&middot;</span>Design activities can facilitate <i>personalconnections</i><span style='font-style:normal'> to knowledge, since designersoften develop a special sense of ownership (and caring) for the products (andideas) that they design.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>&middot;</span>Design activities are often <i>interdisciplinary</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>, bringing together concepts from the arts,mathematics, and sciences. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>&middot;</span>Design activities promote a <i>senseof audience</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, encouraging youth to considerhow other people will use and react to the products they create.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:0in;margin-right:.5in;margin-bottom:8.0pt;margin-left:.5in;text-indent:0in;line-height:normal'><spanstyle='font-family:Symbol'>&middot;</span>Design activities provide a contextfor <i>reflection and discussion</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, enablingyouth to gain a deeper understanding of the ideas underlying hands-onactivities.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Other educational researchers have explored differentaspects of design activities. Idit Harel engaged elementary school students increating their own educational projects to teach fractions to other schoolchildren (Harel, 1990). Gerhard Fischer has been studying how computationalenvironments can support transparent design, where the users notice only theproblems they must solve, and not the computational framework around them(Fischer and Lemke, 1987-88, Fischer, 1993). Mitchel Resnick created StarLogoto encourage a new type of &#8220;decentralized&#8221; mindset to enable kidsto learn about and model complex systems (Resnick, 1994). Alex Repenning hasstudied how children program and has been developing new graphical techniquesto lower the threshold for programming (Repenning, 1994, 1995, 1996).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>If it is good for kids to engage in design activities,then we should provide them with good construction kits. There have beenseveral different types of &#8220;computational construction kits&#8221;developed by researchers for design activities. One of the earliest and mostpopular was Logo. Logo enabled kids to teach a robot-like turtle how to dosimple tasks. They could use the turtle to explore mathematics, geometry, andmore recently, storytelling, animation, and games. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Other researchers have chosen to explore constructionistenvironments where the focus was not on the computer screen, but in thephysical world. One such environment was LEGO/Logo. This activity combinedmultiple types of design, using LEGO blocks as a mechanical design tool andLogo programming as a software design tool (Resnick, et. al, 1996). Thiscombination allowed children to make mechanical creatures and endow them withbehaviors, such as a paranoid robotic car that ran away from light, or a socialant that liked to dance with other bugs (Braitenberg, 1984). The 6.270 RobotDesign Contest at MIT grew out of this work. Students created robots out ofLEGO and programmed them to solve a series of tasks autonomously. Fred Martin,one of the contest&#8217;s designers, wanted to explore how MIT engineeringstudents thought about the process of design and implementation, and how muchthey could balance real-world problems with idealistic designs (Martin, 1994).</p><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022512"></a><aname="_Toc386022579"></a><a name="_Toc386188480"></a><a name="_Toc387909789"></a><aname="_Toc387913281"></a><a name="_Toc388971344">2.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Why Games?</a></h2><p class=MsoBodyText>No matter which generation you are in, playing games is anintegral part of childhood. Growing up, I was involved in nursery school gameslike tag and leapfrog. Once I entered elementary school I started playingsoccer and baseball. These games held my interest for awhile, but I sensed thatorganized sports weren&#8217;t for me and eventually dropped out by sixthgrade. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>There was one type of game that I started playing andhaven&#8217;t yet stopped&#8212;video games. When I was 9, our family got anAtari 2600. We played Space Invaders and Combat and Street Racer. I had a lotof fun down in the basement with my brother and sister, daring them to scoremore points than me. One month, my dad surprised us and got Pac Man. This wassupposed to be the most amazing game out at the time. But my dad wouldn&#8217;tlet me play it until I learned how to ride my bike without training wheels. Itried and I tried, but I couldn&#8217;t get over my fear of falling down. Mybrother and sister were having the best time playing Pac Man. They played italmost everyday. I think they did it just to get to me. Well, it did, so oneday I took my bike out of the garage, brought it to the street and rode downthe block without my training wheels. I went straight to my parents, told themwhat I had done, and stormed right downstairs to play my first game of Pac Man.I&#8217;m not sure of which event I was more proud, riding my bike or playingPac Man.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Video games are in today&#8217;s &#8220;kid culture&#8221;(Jenkins, 1993). This game culture started out with games like Space Invadersand Pac Man, but has quickly progressed to Super Mario Bros., Doom and thecurrent favorite, Diablo. Children love to play games. They have a deepconnection to them because the games transport them to a fantasy world wherethey can discover unexplored territory, take their hero on a quest to save theprincess, and shut out all other distractions (including their parents). Kidsalso like to talk about games with other children. They trade gaming hints,like where all the secret doors are, and reflect on gaming strategies, such aswhat order to solve the puzzles of a game in, or which pattern of moves willenable you to get the most points in Street Fighter.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Since games are so much in the culture, we should harnessthem to constructionism. There have been many building games, likeRocky&#8217;s Boots and The Incredible Machine, that allow kids to buildcontraptions to solve puzzles. But these games only allow children to explorethe design space which the authors allow. Why not give kids the opportunity todesign and create their own games? If we give them good construction tools,then they could not only be creating something personally meaningful, but theyalso would be connecting to math, science, programming and other importantdomains of knowledge. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Over the years, several researchers have created new typesof environments to explore the constructionist approach to video games. Forexample, Yasmin Kafai investigated ways in which children at HenniganElementary School in inner-city Boston could use Logo to make educational videogames to teach younger kids about the solar system. These games triggered thechildren&#8217;s interest because they were not perceived as boring schoolwork,but as fun projects in which they actually could learn about science and teachothers about it, too (Kafai, 1993).</p><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022513"></a><aname="_Toc386022580"></a><a name="_Toc386188481"></a><a name="_Toc387909790"></a><aname="_Toc387913282"></a><a name="_Toc388971345">2.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Why Network?</a></h2><p class=MsoBodyText>At the end of the year, Kafai&#8217;s kids&#8217; projectswere presented to the parents at a game fair. Children took their parents on awalkthrough, showing them all of the interesting things that one could learnabout the solar system. However, it would have been better if it were easy topublish these games, so that anyone could try them. Anyone would be able togive the children feedback about their games and offer suggestions forimprovements. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>The rise of the Internet presents this opportunity,enabling kids to create projects that reach a much larger audience than everbefore. Several educational researchers have created &#8220;communities oflearners&#8221; on the Internet, where school children collaborate onproblem-solving activities and experiments. Scardamalia and Bereiter havelooked at &#8220;knowledge building communities&#8221; and how learning ingroups changes and distributes the acquisition of knowledge (Scardamalia andBereiter, 1994). Songer studied children working together to use the Internetas a medium for engaging in science activities (Songer, 1996). </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Other researchers have concentrated on making the Internetinto a place where children can collaborate together to construct personallymeaningful objects. Amy Bruckman created a virtual world, or MUD, where kidscan congregate, socialize and actively create and design their environment(Bruckman, 1997). Children on MOOSE Crossing can create their own objects. Forexample, one girl&#8217;s pet penguin object won&#8217;t eat shrimp whenit&#8217;s on a diet. This object interacts with its environment and with othermembers of the MOOSE community. This constructionist community of designersforms the basis for a type of learning that accelerates kids&#8217;understanding of programming. Everyone in the community has a common focus,creating new objects, and helps one another by sharing programming skills andassisting less-experienced users. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>A sense of community can also be found on the World WideWeb. The Web's introduction several years ago created a global audience thatcan browse what designers create. The Web has given everybody the ability todesign web pages, where they can explain who they are, show a picture of whatthey look like and share their favorite links. The web&#8217;s architecturealso encourages children to build on each other&#8217;s work. Every browsersupports &#8220;view source,&#8221; where kids can find out how the authorwrote their web page.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Up until now, however, further opportunities for designhave been constrained by the static nature of the Web&#8217;s content. Java, anew Internet language designed by Sun Microsystems, has opened the door towardricher dynamic content on the Web. Using Java, a person may create asimulation, an animation or even an interactive video game. But there is aproblem. Java is intended only for expert programmers. This thesis extends Javaby creating the Bongo programming language, so that kids can gain access to aconstructionist design environment on the Web. Earlier projects have shown thatvideo games can be an exciting design and learning domain. This thesis presentsthe design and implementation of a video game construction kit, a tool thatenables kids to easily design and implement video games to share with others onthe WWW.</p></div><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Times'><br clear=ALLstyle='page-break-before:always'></span><div class=Section4><h1 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022514"></a><aname="_Toc386022581"></a><a name="_Toc386188482"></a><a name="_Toc387909791"></a><aname="_Toc387913283"></a><a name="_Toc388971346">3.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Related Computational Construction Kits</a></h1><p class=MsoBodyText>This chapter discusses several different types ofcomputational construction kits. By no means a complete listing, this selectionof examples is presented here to illustrate various design considerations thatother researchers have taken in their research. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>The first section, &#8220;General-purpose ConstructionKits,&#8221; discusses Logo, Boxer, Agentsheets, and Cocoa and illustrates howthese kits have been used with children, and advantages and disadvantages toeach of their approaches to learning. The second section, &#8220;ConstructionGames,&#8221; introduces several games that use a construction metaphor toengage children in design. Rocky&#8217;s Boots, Robot Odyssey, The IncredibleMachine, and Widget Workshop are all widely varying examples of constructiongames that have been popular with kids in the past. The last section,&#8220;Video Games,&#8221; specifically talks about video game constructionkits and how these kits approach the task of enabling children to easily createtheir own video games.</p><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc388971347">3.1<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>General-purposeConstruction Kits</a></h2><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022516"></a><aname="_Toc386022583"></a><a name="_Toc386188484"></a><a name="_Toc387909793"></a><aname="_Toc387913285"></a><a name="_Toc388971348">3.1.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Logo</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>Logo, designed in the 1960&#8217;s, was one of the firstprogramming languages created for children. A team of researchers at BBN andMIT, including Seymour Papert and Wally Feurzeig, created this variant of Lispto meet specific design goals. They wanted to make Lisp more accessible tonon-programmers, especially children. They achieved this in several ways.First, they simplified Lisp&#8217;s syntax, removing parentheses, reducing thenumber of syntactic forms and shrinking the primitive sets. They did, however,keep Lisp&#8217;s dynamically-scoped, procedural semantics.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another approach to enhance Logo&#8217;s understandabilitywas to leverage it off natural language. Whenever a child tried to ask Logo todo something it didn&#8217;t understand, Logo would respond, &#8220;Idon&#8217;t know how to do that.&#8221; Children could then teach the Logointerpreter how to do different tasks by saying &#8220;to make-a-square&#8221;and writing a procedure that told the computer how to make a square. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>One of the overall results of Logo was that itsaccessibility provided a gateway through which children could reach manydifferent problem domains where interesting questions lay. In the programmingdomain itself, children might discover recursion as a way to tell a procedureto repeat over and over again. They could learn new debugging skills when thecomputer executed a procedure differently than they had thought it would. Theycould also actively explore the Logo environment by interacting through acommand center. Here, they could try out new commands and receive instantfeedback about what they did. This helped immensely in debugging efforts, sincechildren could try procedures with many different inputs to understand itscomplete behavior. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Outside of the programming domain, the introduction of theLogo Turtle (Papert, 1980) allowed kids to reach &#8220;Mathland.&#8221;Mathland was a metaphor for a place where children could use math as fluentlyas they used language. The Logo Turtle enabled children to think aboutmathematics and geometry using <i>body syntonics</i><span style='font-style:normal'>. Children could envision themselves as the turtle, moving around onthe ground to draw geometrical figures. This enabled children to think about </span><i>computational</i><span style='font-style:normal'> geometry, instead of the more traditionalEuclidean or Aristotelian geometry. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>Logo became very popular in elementary schools, and withthe help of <i>Mindstorms </i><span style='font-style:normal'>(Papert, 1980)</span><i>,Turtle Geometry </i><span style='font-style:normal'>(Abelson and diSessa,1986), and other educational books, many people thought that the children wouldeasily make it to Mathland. Unfortunately, for all of the powerful ideas thatLogo might help children to reach, it didn&#8217;t achieve the epistemologicalsuccess that Papert sought. This was due to several problems: the inertia ofthe school system to resist change, the paucity of computers in schools, andthe tendency of teachers to lecture to children, instead of letting them learnon their own. Others thought that some problems were due to Logo itself, ratherthan how it was deployed and used. They thought that Logo was too low-level andthat domain-specific tools might be better to engage kids in learning(O&#8217;Shea, in press).</span></p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909794"></a><aname="_Toc387913286"></a><a name="_Toc388971349">3.1.1.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Variants of Logo</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>Since the 1960&#8217;s, the Logo turtle has been used inmany different types of Logo programming environments, including moving fromrobotic form to screen form in the very popular Apple Logo, written by LCSI(Logo Computer Systems Inc). For many years, Apple Logo was used in elementaryschools to teach geometry and math. In the mid 1980&#8217;s, LCSI introducedLogo Writer. This version opened up the design space further by adding turtleshapes and multiple turtles. Children could assign turtles different shapes andcreate stories using the new characters they made. Kids could also create videogames, for example, by using a turtle for the enemy, a turtle for the hero andsome turtles for the bullets.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>At this point in Logo&#8217;s history, the technologycould not yet match the kids&#8217; expectations. Some of Kafai's studentswould come to school with grandiose plans about what they would work on thatday, but then run up against technological limitations in Logo Writer. Kidswanted more turtles so they could have more than four characters at a time.There was also no multi-threading, so it was not easy to tell all of theturtles to do different things at the same time (Kafai, 1993).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>The next Logo by LCSI was MicroWorlds. This version,introduced in 1992, included support for modern computer features likemultimedia, sprite animation, sounds, movies, and paint tools. It introducedmultiple processes, so kids could more easily program turtles independently andnot worry about managing multi-threaded program flow. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>MicroWorlds&#8217; use of multiple processes was inspiredby MultiLogo and StarLogo, both created by Mitchel Resnick (Resnick, 1991,1994). StarLogo, written for the Connection Machine 2 parallel computer, addedmany more turtles to the Logo canvas. Users could have up to 16,000 turtles,instead of merely one or two. It opened up a whole new design space wherechildren could model ant colonies, flocks of birds, or even create ideal gasmolecular simulations. StarLogo suffered from one disadvantage, however. CM2scost about one million dollars, so anyone who wanted to use StarLogo had tocome to MIT.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In order to alleviate the access problem, StarLogo wasported to the Macintosh. A very lightweight process switcher enabled the serialprocessor of the Macintosh to emulate the 16,384 processors of the ConnectionMachine. A SPMD architecture (single program, multiple data: many turtles eachrunning one program, but each with their own program counter) was also adopted.This provided an advantage over the SIMD model of computation (singleinstruction multiple data: many turtles, each running one program in sync) onthe CM2 because now each turtle was now free to run separate pieces of code atthe same time. The move to the Macintosh also enabled the addition of extragraphics and user interface features that were impossible on the CM2, such assprites, paint tools and an interface builder. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>The sprite graphics, combined with <i>breeds</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>, a turtle grouping feature, turned out to be aninteresting addition to StarLogo, that allowed users to more easily identifywith the simulations they were creating. During the summer of 1996, MITundergraduates David Feinberg and Carlos Mochon used StarLogo to recreate twoclassic video games, Pacman and Frogger. The games looked and felt just likethe originals and were fun to play. They were also unexpectedly easy toprogram. These video games were the inspiration for the work described in thisthesis.</span></p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022517"></a><aname="_Toc386022584"></a><a name="_Toc386188485"></a><a name="_Toc387909795"></a><aname="_Toc387913287"></a><a name="_Toc388971350">3.1.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Boxer</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>Boxer is a unique programming environment that embodiesthe ideals of Logo, Lisp and Smalltalk (diSessa and Abelson, 1986). Invented byAndy diSessa and Hal Abelson, it explores the transformation of Logo from aprocedural text-based environment into an object-oriented hybridgraphical-textual environment. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Before the 80&#8217;s, Logo never really concentrated onthe programming environment in which the children created their projects. Atbest, children could hope for a split screen approach, where they could see theturtle or the procedures, but never both at the same time. Boxer, in theSmalltalk tradition, integrated the procedures page with the graphics page andcreated a multimedia graphical approach to programming. Boxer actuallyforeshadowed the World Wide Web and document-based computing because it turnedall data, including multimedia, into first-class manipulable objects on thescreen.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Boxer&#8217;s basic building block is the box. Boxes cancontain programs, data, text, pictures, and even other boxes (therebysupporting hierarchical structures and abstraction). Boxer&#8217;s display ofits collapsible boxes (which visually indicate black boxing) &#8220;encourageprogrammers to interpret the organization of the computational system in termsof spatial relationships&#8221; (diSessa and Abelson, 1986). Children can alsoanalyze dynamic program flow by employing the &#8220;Little Man&#8221;explanation of structural programming. Whenever a procedure calls another one,it appears as a box inside the first procedure call. When that procedure isfinished, the box collapses and the original procedure regains control(diSessa, 1986).</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386188486"></a><aname="_Toc387909796"></a><a name="_Toc387913288"></a><a name="_Toc388971351">3.1.3<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Agentsheets</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>Agentsheets is a visual programming construction kitcreated by Alex Repenning at the University of Colorado (Repenning, 1994). Thefirst version of Agentsheets used a purely graphical approach to programmingagents (similar to Logo turtles) that occupy cells in a grid. Using graphicalrewrite rules to illustrate transitions from one picture state to the next, theagents can be programmed to move around the grid and interact with each other.This model of computation is very similar to the Turing machine model. But,like the Turing model, it suffers from an exponential rule growth.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Repenning writes that programming via graphicalmanipulation lowers the threshold for beginning programmers, especially kids.He has also experimented with a form of physical programming involving a robotand LEGO road base plates. Children programmed the car to always stay on theroad, and could meta-program the robot by putting different road plates infront of it. This way they could make the robot go anywhere they wanted withoutever typing a single command (Eden, et. al. 1996).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Recently, with the development of Visual Agentalk,Repenning has shifted his model of programming from graphical rewrite rules toa more programmable, direct manipulation approach (Repenning and Ambach,1996a,b). Using command and sensor blocks in a stimulus-response framework,programmers can create behaviors using parameterized blocks. This alleviatesmuch of the problem with the explosion of rules because it raises theabstraction level of programming above the Turing model. In addition, the usercan try out commands or stimulus-response rules directly by dragging them ontop of the agents. This allows the user to test and debug commands and rulesinteractively while programming.</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022518"></a><aname="_Toc386022585"></a><a name="_Toc386188487"></a><a name="_Toc387909797"></a><aname="_Toc387913289"></a><a name="_Toc388971352">3.1.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Cocoa (Kidsim)</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>Cocoa, a product from Apple Computer, is similar to thefirst version of Agentsheets. Created by Alan Cypher and David Smith,Cocoa&#8217;s programming style is an extreme experiment in pure graphicalrewrite rule programming (Smith, Cypher, Spohrer, 1994). Intended as anintroduction to programming for young children, kids can create their ownsimple projects by defining characters from a palette and placing them on aplayfield. Similar to Agentsheets, the children can define transitions betweenbefore and after graphics to control the characters on the field. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Cocoa suffers from the same exponential blowup of rules asAgentsheets, but the designers feel that the increased usability andunderstandability of the simple rules allow children to more easily expressthemselves. Rather than working to raise Cocoa&#8217;s ceiling, they feel thatadding more modalities and breadth of I/O to Cocoa is a better way to enticemore children to program. (Cypher, 1996)</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Apple has invested quite a bit of time and money into thebackground support of Cocoa. They recently introduced a Cocoa plug-in forNetscape, which allows kids to play their games (but not create them) on theWeb. Apple also maintains a web site that allows kids to publish their projectsand even participate in a best game contest. This web site is an important stepin widening the audience for kids&#8217; projects. Prior to the Web, childrencould create projects, but could only show them off to their friends in thesame room. With the Web, however, children can publish their projects to a muchwider audience and enjoy the benefits of this new interaction.</p><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022520"></a><aname="_Toc386022587"></a><a name="_Toc386188489"></a><a name="_Toc387909798"></a><aname="_Toc387913290"></a><a name="_Toc388971353">3.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Construction Games</a></h2><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022521"></a><aname="_Toc386022588"></a><a name="_Toc386188490"></a><a name="_Toc387909799"></a><aname="_Toc387913291"></a><a name="_Toc388971354">3.2.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Rocky&#8217;s Boots</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>There were a number of games introduced in the early1980&#8217;s that incorporated the construction kit metaphor in the activityitself. Rocky&#8217;s Boots, designed by Warren Robinett, allowed kids to learnlogic and circuit design by constructing digital circuits. Each level of thegame had challenging problems where children would wire up block sensors tovarious types of digital gates in order to recognize and &#8220;boot&#8221; acertain pattern of blocks. For example, if there were six blocks on the screen,and you were instructed to &#8220;boot&#8221; the red triangles, you couldconnect up a triangle shape sensor and a red color sensor to an AND gate whichwould then connect to the Boot. Whenever the sensors were both triggered by thered triangles, the Boot would kick the block out of the way and you would earnsome points. There were also more complex sequence problems such as recognizinga red triangle only after seeing a blue square.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>A graphical programming approach was used in thisenvironment, as well as an electric data flow model. Similar to Widget Workshop(which is a much more recent game and is described below), children couldconnect wires between various logic gates and flip-flops in order to create acircuit. The kit had some facilities to aid debugging these circuits. When thepower was turned on, you could watch the action of your digital circuit as thecurrent flowed through the machine. You could also turn a dial to control thespeed of the electric flow. Rocky&#8217;s Boots contained different rooms inits world where you could quickly try out different circuit combinations. Itwas also a modifiable environment. Children could build their own variants ofRocky&#8217;s Boots games and challenge their friends with difficult sequencesof blocks.</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022522"></a><aname="_Toc386022589"></a><a name="_Toc386188491"></a><a name="_Toc387909800"></a><aname="_Toc387913292"></a><a name="_Toc388971355">3.2.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Robot Odyssey</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>Robot Odyssey, a game from the Learning Company, followedin Rocky&#8217;s Boots footsteps. It continued the use of the electric dataflow model, but applied it to a robot&#8217;s brain. Children could program arobot to move around and interact with objects in a virtual world on thecomputer screen. Inside the robot&#8217;s head were a variety of sensors andactuators that could be wired together through logic gates, flip-flops andIC&#8217;s. To make a robot that followed the wall, a child would wire the leftwall bumper to the right and rear thruster, thus keeping the robot against thewall and moving it forward at the same time. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Robot Odyssey also used a graphical environment, butexpanded on the spatial metaphor by constructing an elaborate virtual worldwith puzzles to solve in every room. The child could try out a variety ofrobots in each room and test different circuits to see which would work thebest. The instruction manual included with the game also gave quite a fewexample challenge problems. These ranged from wall-following to finding a keyin a maze of stairways. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>While the environment supported active exploration ofvarious circuit ideas, it wasn&#8217;t easy to create a circuit that wouldwork. This problem isn&#8217;t particular to this game, however; it is aproblem that plagues robot designers to this day. Fred Martin, a researcher inthe Epistemology and Learning Group, helped create the 6.270 LEGO Robot DesignContest at MIT. Students had to build a robot out of LEGO and program it toperform autonomously in a sixty-second contest against another robot. Often,the MIT students had problems overcoming noisy sensors, incorrect assumptionsof environmental conditions, and problems learning exactly what the actuatorscould and could not do. On the other hand, students learned system theoryrelated to control and feedback, bottom-up design, and programming techniquesfor unpredictable, non-ideal, noisy, environmental conditions (Martin, 1994).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Robot Odyssey supports black boxing. Children&#8217;scircuits often get large, gangly and unwieldy, turning into tangles of wires.Robot Odyssey&#8217;s circuit metaphor extends to IC chips, which provide angood metaphor for black boxing large programs. By moving the robot to the chipburning room, children can take a snapshot of a its &#8220;brain&#8221;(disconnected from its inputs and outputs) and burn a new chip with the programinside. Then they can put this chip inside the robot head and wire it directlyto the sensors and actuators with very little mess. This works well, exceptthat children sometimes forget what the input and output pins of a particularIC do. To help avoid this problem, Robot Odyssey provides a documentation toolto record the description of the inputs and outputs of the chips.</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022523"></a><aname="_Toc386022590"></a><a name="_Toc386188492"></a><a name="_Toc387909801"></a><aname="_Toc387913293"></a><a name="_Toc388971356">3.2.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>The Incredible Machine</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>The Incredible Machine, published by Sierra On-Line, is aconstruction kit in which kids put together a Rube-Goldberg contraption tosolve a puzzle. By connecting pianos, traps, levers and guns, kids can solveeach new level of the game. The Incredible Machine uses a direct manipulationstyle interface, where each element in the parts palette can be dragged outonto the screen. The user can easily test out different configurations of partsto see if it would solve the puzzle. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>One problem with this game is that sometimes the partsneeded to be perfectly aligned in order for them to work, and there are novisual clues other than running the simulation to find this out. The game isalso not customizable; the parts are static. The user can not extend the gameto include more parts or modify existing ones to exhibit different behaviors.Sometimes the machines that are created get quite complex, so a facility forabstraction and black boxing a particular machine would be helpful, too. Thenext version of The Incredible Machine adds the ability to create new puzzles,so the user can devise their own challenges for their friends.</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022524"></a><aname="_Toc386022591"></a><a name="_Toc386188493"></a><a name="_Toc386022519"></a><aname="_Toc386022586"></a><a name="_Toc386188488"></a><a name="_Toc387909802"></a><aname="_Toc387913294"></a><a name="_Toc388971357">3.2.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Widget Workshop</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>Widget Workshop is a product published by Maxis, thecompany that makes SimCity and other popular simulation games. Using WidgetWorkshop, children can make complicated machines from timers, switches, gates,and other graphical objects that perform different tasks. Children arechallenged to create the right machine to achieve a particular goal, such asturning on a light, or making a Rube-Goldberg contraption work correctly.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Widget Workshop uses a data flow metaphor. Using wires toconnect different parts together, children wire up inputs to outputs and createlarge information flow graphs. Widget Workshop is also graphical, so childrenuse the mouse to directly manipulate the parts on the screen to place them intheir proper locations. When the children have finished building a machine,they turn on the power and the machine starts to compute. If they haveconnected everything together correctly, a light goes on and a bell rings. Thedesigners of this construction kit were very aware of the importance of goodgraphics and sound in keeping the child&#8217;s attention. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>There are some problems with this program, however. Thereis a large library of parts, and none of them are identified with any textlabels. Sometimes the icons are not plain enough to decode what they do. To abeginner using this program, this might be intimidating. There also is nofacility for abstracting or black boxing a machine that a child has made. Some oftheir challenge problems require a large array of parts to be strung together,and without any means of black boxing, the screen quickly becomes a tangledmess of data flow wires. There also are no debugging tools in the programmingenvironment. The only evidence that a machine didn&#8217;t work is that thelight and sound didn&#8217;t go on. Some animation of data flow through thewires might be a plausible way to illustrate this, in addition to a testbedwhere the child could try out different configurations of parts to produceintermediate outputs.</p><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909803"></a><aname="_Toc387913295"></a><a name="_Toc388971358">3.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Video Games</a></h2><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022525"></a><aname="_Toc386022592"></a><a name="_Toc386188494"></a><a name="_Toc386022527"></a><aname="_Toc386022594"></a><a name="_Toc386188495"></a><a name="_Toc387909804"></a><aname="_Toc387913296"></a><a name="_Toc388971359">3.3.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Pinball Construction Set</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>Pinball Construction Set, written by Bill Budge, is adesign kit that lets kids build pinball machines and play with them. Childrencan choose parts from a palette of bumpers, pins, racks, and flippers to createthe ultimate pinball game. Users use direct manipulation to drag parts off thepalette and place them on the playing field. They can also paint a backgroundon the game. The set allows users to control system parameters like gravity,elasticity of the bumpers, and the speed of the game itself. An advancedfeature allows users to use Boolean logic to specify how points are scoredbased on the particular bumpers and knobs that the ball hit during play. Oncethe user is done constructing their game, they can press the &#8220;MakeGame&#8221; button which saves the completed game on the disk for people toplay. This saved version does not include the development environment, however,so finished games are not modifiable. In addition, without the original&#8220;source code,&#8221; you can not reverse engineer a pinball game to seehow it was constructed.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>While Pinball Construction Set made it easy for childrento create interesting pinball games for themselves and their friends, it didhave some problems. It did not have any intelligence about where you wereallowed to put pinball game pieces on the screen. You could easily make astructure that the ball could never reach, or a pocket where the ball wouldalways become trapped. Fischer and Lemke argue that construction kits shouldhave semantic knowledge of their programming domain and help the user avoidthese dynamic &#8220;run-time&#8221; errors. (Fischer and Lemke, 1987-88).</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909805"></a><aname="_Toc387913297"></a><a name="_Toc388971360">3.3.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Klik &amp; Play / The Game Factory</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>In a totally different genre of building tool, Klik andPlay (from Maxis) and its big brother, The Game Factory (from Europress), arevideo game construction kits that allow kids to create Nintendo-style videogames easily. Employing a form of visual programming, Klik and Play gives theprogrammer a large palette of characters, backgrounds and props. The user maydefine different scenes, or may define a large world that scrolls as the playermoves around in it. The programming environment uses drag and drop to allow theprogrammer to directly manipulate the characters on the screen (i.e. to definea path for a particular character to run, you right-click on the character,click on the Define Path menu item and drag the character around the screen).The game uses the right mouse button to pull up context sensitive menus toaffect the characteristics of an object. Once you have defined your game, youcan press a button, and it turns into a standalone application, playablewithout the construction environment. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>The Game Factory contains a large library of shapes andanimations. The library is almost too large, since there isn&#8217;t muchorganization to its parts. Example characters and parts are only divided bytheir inherent types and not by their purposes in particular games. On theother hand, The Game Factory comes with several pre-built games that can beopened and edited just like any other game. This gives the beginning user abase on which to start learning how to program in the environment.</p></div><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Times'><br clear=ALLstyle='page-break-before:always'></span><div class=Section5><h1 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022528"></a><aname="_Toc386022595"></a><a name="_Toc386188496"></a><a name="_Toc387909806"></a><aname="_Toc387913298"></a><a name="_Toc388971361">4.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Design Space of Video Game Construction Kits</a></h1><p class=MsoBodyText>The creation of a new construction environment forchildren is no easy task. One would hope to build off the lessons learned frompast construction kits, as well as incorporate the latest ideas from theresearch in children&#8217;s learning and cognition. There have been quite afew researchers interested in children&#8217;s cognitive understanding ofprogramming environments (Papert, 1980, 1993, 1996, diSessa and Abelson, 1986,Fischer and Lemke, 1987, Harel, 1988, Kafai, 1993, Resnick, 1994, Smith,Cypher, Spohrer, 1994, Repenning, 1994, 1996, Sargent, 1995, Umaschi, 1997).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Based on this research, I have selected several broadprinciples for creating computational construction kits for children:understandability, uniformity and elegance, interactivity, functionality,transparency, powerful ideas, and reflection and audience.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>This chapter discusses these overall design criteria forconstruction kits, and then speaks specifically about those issues that affectvideo game construction sets in particular. The next chapter proposes a newtype of video game construction kit based on the conclusions of this discussion<aname="_Toc386188497">.</a></p><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909807"></a><aname="_Toc387913299"></a><a name="_Toc388971362">4.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Design Principles of Construction Kits</a></h2><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386188498"></a><aname="_Toc387909808"></a><a name="_Toc387913300"></a><a name="_Toc388971363">4.1.1<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Understandability</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>The most important task of any construction kit designeris to choose metaphors, languages, and tools that enhance theenvironment&#8217;s understandibility. Since non-expert users have a limitedmental model of the system, the construction kit is the tool that creates anabstraction layer between the problem domain and its implementation. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>The different metaphors chosen by the designer allow the usersto connect the design environment to familiar objects and experiences. Logoemployed body syntonicity to allow children to relate the Logo turtle&#8217;saction to their own body&#8217;s movements. Direct manipulation interfaces areused in many systems to minimize the distance between a user&#8217;s actionsand their effects on the screen. Video games employ joystick controllers todirectly control characters on the screen (Schneiderman, 1992). Though someabstract concepts are difficult to express, direct manipulation interfacesgenerally enhance understandability when used appropriately.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Design environments should also have knowledge about howtheir own pieces fit together, and as a result of this information, they shouldbe able to guide the user into putting these parts together in a logical andrational way (Fischer and Lemke, 1987-88). One common pitfall for constructionkits designers is to provide only the construction materials, and forget toinclude the instructions on how the materials are supposed to go together.Using the &#8220;view source&#8221; option, Web browsers allows users to gainaccess to author&#8217;s &#8220;source code.&#8221; This ability to see theunderlying &#8220;real&#8221; representation of the page gives users examplesof correct usage of HTML that allow them to extend their own work in newcreative dimensions. </p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386188499"></a><aname="_Toc387909809"></a><a name="_Toc387913301"></a><a name="_Toc388971364">4.1.2<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Uniformity andElegance</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>Uniformity and elegance are the same idea viewed from twodifferent perspectives. Uniformity is seen by the user of system. When usersencounter a consistent, uniform user interface, it enables them to learn betterand reduce mistakes (Schneiderman, 1992). In a structured user interface, theusers expect that each level will behave similarly&#8212;that the same gesturesand commands will produce equivalent effects. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Elegance is uniformity seen from the programmer&#8217;spoint of view. Programmers strive to achieve elegance in their design andcoding. Often, this involves many code revisions, but when the finished productis done, it can often be admired as a work of art. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>These two concepts may not seem connected at all, but in aconstruction kit, they are tied together intimately. A construction kitdesigner must combine a uniform interface and programming metaphors to allowthe user to understand their system easily. But since the user is also going touse the kit as a construction tool, the kit must allow the user/programmer tocreate elegant code.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Uniformity and elegance are not always easy to achieve,even though they are often desired. In some cases, non-uniformity may actuallyaid in comprehension by exposing flaws in the programming metaphor. These flawsreveal actual implementation details that must be surfaced to the user in orderto give them a clear picture of what is really going on inside the computer.For example, in Boxer, every UI element is a box or contained within one.However, when two boxes need to reference the same object (a common occurrencein most traditional programs), two linked <i>ports</i><span style='font-style:normal'> are used. </span><i>Ports</i><span style='font-style:normal'> are likeboxes, but are linked, so that a change in one </span><i>port</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> is immediately seen in the other. This </span><i>port</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> is necessary to achieve a standard effect incomputer programming, but violates the &#8220;naive realism&#8221; of theinterface.  </span></p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909810"></a><aname="_Toc387913302"></a><a name="_Toc386188503"></a><a name="_Toc387909813"></a><aname="_Toc387913305"></a><a name="_Toc388971365">4.1.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Interactivity</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>&#8220;User interfaces are often considered to beseparable from programming language semantics and almost an afterthought inlanguage design. Worse, most present languages assume only character-streaminput and output. A useful medium must be much more flexiblyinteractive.&#8221; (diSessa and Abelson, 1986). diSessa and Abelson lamentedon the state of programming environments in the mid 1980&#8217;s and thesituation hasn&#8217;t gotten much better for the programming community.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>For special audiences, however, construction kits beingcreated today find ways to become more interactive with their users. Thesystems might support direct manipulation which allows the user to affect theobjects and metaphors present in the interface as if they were concreteobjects. They also might talk back to the user and suggest possible courses ofaction, or give the user help when they notice there might be a problem. Theymay support interactive program development where a child can receive instantfeedback about a program change and be able to debug the program while it isrunning. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>SmallTalk and Boxer pioneered the idea of the combineduser interface and programming language. Apple&#8217;s language, Dylan, had aprogramming environment that was a logical successor and upgrade to theSmallTalk-80 environment (Palmen, 1995). It incorporated color graphics anddrag-and-drop direct manipulation, but Apple closed the project several yearsago due to excessive delays in shipping. Kansas, a research project from SunMicrosystems, is a collaborative shared environment where many users caninteract with each other and the system to create projects. A derivative ofSelf, itself a derivative of SmallTalk, Kansas supports interactive shareddebugging in its networked environment by actively transporting its users toOz, a shared graphical debugger, whenever a serious problem occurs (Smith,Wolczko, Ungar, 1997).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In programming, a construction environment that supportsinteractive development is necessary. If active exploration, undo/redo, directmanipulation, and feedback are part of the interface experience, then in thetradition of Boxer and SmallTalk, why shouldn&#8217;t they be also a part ofthe programming experience as well? These concepts would make programmingeasier, less frightening (since a child could try out lots of things quicklywithout fear of breaking the system) and bring it closer to the actual domainin which the child is working. A challenge for general-purpose constructionkits is to provide some type of general direct manipulation interface withoutbecoming too abstract in the actual problem domain that the child wishes toexplore.</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc388971366">4.1.4<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Functionality</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>There are several different degrees of functionality thata construction environment must support. First, it must be capable enough tocreate a variety of outputs in the domain in which it operates. In the videogame realm, it must be capable of producing a video game that supportsgraphics, animation, and some form of player control. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Once the basic formula has been created, what then? Whatextra functionality does the system support? A system could provide moreinteresting inputs and outputs or more modalities with which the user mightcontrol the system and receive information from it. Agentsheets and Cocoa haveexplored these types of functionalities quite extensively. Other systems couldbranch out in orthogonal directions, incorporating 3D graphics, animationcreation and scripting, and complex character behavior generation. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Randy Sargent explored how multiple input and outputmodalities affect the kinds of projects you can make. He found that the varietyof activities does not increase linearly with the number of things the programcan connect to, but grows exponentially. Most of the simple and interestingapplications of a program can be found at the intersections between things theprogram can read in and things that the program can output. Since complex applicationswill involve more than one input/output pair, and each modality can interfaceto many different things in the world, the number of possible activities growsat a very high rate (Sargent, 1995).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>There is a tradeoff between usability and expressivenessin domain-specific and general-purpose systems (Repenning, 1996). Adomain-specific system can be used to provide highly specialized tools whichare capable of producing very polished projects. Since the author of the kitunderstands everything about the particular domain, he may provide a completeset of tools with which to work. On the other hand, a general-purpose system isflexible enough to explore multiple domains, especially those that the designerhadn&#8217;t intended. Indeed, a creative user might use a general-purposedesign kit to explore a particular domain of interest as deeply as adomain-specific tool, though the threshold might be higher.</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc388971367">4.1.5<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Transparency</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>&#8220;Is the system made from turtles all the waydown?&#8221; This Logo clich&eacute; is often used to describe systems that arecreated in their own programming environments. Systems like Lisp and SmallTalkare written in earlier versions of themselves and serve as platforms forprogramming new features. Thus, when a programmer doesn&#8217;t understand howa certain Lisp procedure works, he/she may search through the source code andread how it was done. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>A similar principle could be at work in construction kitsfor non-expert programmers. If the system is powerful and general enough to bewritten in itself, then when the user doesn&#8217;t understand how a pieceworks, he/she can choose to look at the &#8220;source code.&#8221; Somesystems, like Agentsheets are not written in themselves. To create a newgraphical agent or new type of rule, you must program it in Lisp. Clearly, forthe person who is a perfectly comfortable user of Agentsheets and not a Lispprogrammer, the system will not be extensible without having an expertprogrammer on call. </p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022529"></a><aname="_Toc386022596"></a><a name="_Toc386188504"></a><a name="_Toc387909814"></a><aname="_Toc387913306"></a><a name="_Toc386188502"></a><a name="_Toc387909812"></a><aname="_Toc387913304"></a><a name="_Toc388971368">4.1.6<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Powerful Ideas</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>Construction kit designers have a vested interest inmaking a fun toolkit that children can use to explore a large design space. Inorder to capture the children&#8217;s interest, the scope of the design spacemust include topics that are personally meaningful. Video games have been inthe &#8220;kid culture&#8221; since the late 1970&#8217;s, and serve as a verycompelling medium for exploration. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>While a toolkit can merely be a vehicle for designingvideo games, it could also be utilized as a way to learn while designing. Itcan provide children the means to reach <i>powerful ideas</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>. Seymour Papert used the phrase </span><i>powerfulideas</i><span style='font-style:normal'> to describe fundamental conceptsthat, when realized or learned, provide leverage for exploring new domains(Papert, 1980). Some of these concepts, like logic, probability, feedback andabstraction can be encountered while designing and implementing a video game.Comprehension of these concepts is valuable since they directly apply to manydifferent domains, but as cognitive tools, they provide the leverage to exploreand design in new domains. Life is about exploring different domains ofknowledge and creating new knowledge in each of them. A person&#8217;s personalinterests guide them through life&#8217;s design space and enable them to learnabout new domains that are personally meaningful.</span></p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc388971369">4.1.7<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Reflection andAudience</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>Reflection upon the design process and its result is anextremely important part of any design experience. Construction kits shouldsupport reflection in its many forms. One such form, iterative design, allowsprogrammers to create and refine their ideas about the system they are building.Harel and Kafai asked all the children participating in their project to keep anotebook log of what they had accomplished each day. Reflection is an importantpart of this design process; without it, there would be no checks or bounds onthe direction of the project.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another aspect of reflection is the evaluation of thefinal design and product. Did it perform up to its expectations? Is thereanything else to add? What modifications could be made to make it different orbetter? Other people might also take a look at the final product and offersuggestions. In the past, most school projects were shown off tochildren&#8217;s friends, or to parents on Parent-Teacher night. But, with therise of the Web, a child can post their project for everyone to see. They canalso advertise it in schools newsgroups or via mailing lists. People that thechild doesn&#8217;t even know can stop by to take a look. They can comment onthe work through email, perhaps suggesting new ideas or differentimplementations. Children can also surf the Web and see other kids&#8217; gameson the net and get new ideas for projects of their own. The Web opens up anddiversifies the audience for a child&#8217;s project.</p><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc388971370">4.2<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Design Issuesfor Video Game Construction Kits</a></h2><p class=MsoBodyText>There are quite a few specific design issues for videogame construction kits. Some are involved with game construction; others haveto do with the programming environment and language that the child programs in.Each of the different issues affects the process of creating games anddetermines what kinds of games can be constructed. Through the prior analysisof both general-purpose and domain-specific construction kits, this sectionhopes to make clear some good directions and tradeoffs in the construction kitdesign. </p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022530"></a><aname="_Toc386022597"></a><a name="_Toc386022535"></a><a name="_Toc386022602"></a><aname="_Toc386188505"></a><a name="_Toc386188506"></a><a name="_Toc387909815"></a><aname="_Toc387913307"></a><a name="_Toc388971371">4.2.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Game Construction</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>This section covers several different areas that affecthow children sit down and create games. The first part examines what happens tothe design process when either one or more children interact to create aproject. The second part explores how the quantity and type of examplesincluded in the kit affect the children&#8217;s exploration of design space.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022531"></a><aname="_Toc386022598"></a><a name="_Toc387909816"></a><a name="_Toc387913308"></a><aname="_Toc388971372">4.2.1.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One Constructor or Collaborative Construction?</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>While there are many different considerations forconstruction kit design, one that affects the programming environment the mostis whether the toolkit is geared toward one constructor or a community ofconstructors. A one constructor model allows an easier and less complex design,since many problems that come with coordinating multiple programmers just donot occur in a single user environment. On the other hand, many children tendto work in groups on projects, whether due to lack of computer resources orwhile working on group activities. A construction kit that supported acollaborative video game creation environment could be quite desirable.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In a one constructor model, the construction kit designermust take care to engage the user. The environment should be simple enough tobe understood by one person working alone, but support a deep enough experiencethat the child won&#8217;t get bored quickly. The system can also make theassumption that the single creator knows everything about the project on whichthey are working. It doesn&#8217;t have to resolve design conflicts that comefrom having more than one programmer. On the other hand, some researchers feelthat the system should then take an active role in guiding the programmertowards interesting areas of the video game domain, or invite them to explorelittle-used, but interesting features (Fischer, 1993).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>A single user system can also take advantage of themultiple modalities of today&#8217;s modern user interfaces. In many computers,there are keyboard, mouse, joystick, sound, and sometimes pen inputs. Since theuser is always sitting in front of the computer, the system may use all ofthese to create a complete user interface.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>All of the early construction environments were gearedtowards one child construction because networking was not widespread enough. Ifa joint effort was desired, two kids would get behind the computer, one controllingthe keyboard, and the other controlling the mouse. A few more would gatherbehind them and &#8220;drive&#8221; by shouting commands to them. &#8220;Movethe mouse over there!&#8221; &#8220;Tell that turtle to go forward 1!&#8221;</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another more common type of collaboration occurs inclassrooms where children are working on programming projects. One child willlook at the other&#8217;s screen and copy anything that seems interesting. Overthe course of a few hours, quite a few ideas could spread throughout the entireclassroom in a form of low-tech networking.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>If networking is available, then instead of asking&#8220;how many people can you fit around one computer?&#8221; you might ask&#8220;will people working at their own computers construct the same projecttogether or work on different projects separately?&#8221; In addition, youmight ask if these people will work asynchronously or synchronously with eachother. Asynchronous environments like the Web enable off-line construction.People create projects by themselves and then publish them on-line. Synchronousenvironments allow multiple people to collaborate together in real-time todevelop a project. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Some existing environments have taken different stances onthe above two questions, but many support more than one style of construction.MOOSE Crossing, a MOO created for kids by Amy Bruckman, supports childrenworking on separate projects in a shared world (Bruckman, 1997). However, sinceMOO&#8217;s are object-oriented, children&#8217;s projects are usually relatedby parent-child-sibling inheritance relationships. In Kansas, a sharedgraphical programming environment written by Smith, Wolczko and Ungar at SunMicrosystems, researchers work together to debug problems that cause part ofthe system to crash (Smith, Wolczko, Ungar 1997). In Castle Infinity, anadventure game published by Starwave Corp., children must work together tosolve puzzles and finish a quest in a shared graphical world.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In a collaborative environment, kit designers shouldconsider a few policy decisions that can affect the rest of the environment andthe construction process. How do the children divide up the labor? How do theyassign access control and permissions on objects? How are they able tocommunicate with each other while working on a project? And, finally, when theyare all done, how do they publish and advertise their project to everyone else?</p><h6 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>How do the children divide up thelabor? </h6><p class=MsoBodyText>In a shared project, children are required to worktogether to construct something. How should they decide how to divide up thelabor? In a video game project, they each might work on the behaviors for adifferent character. Then they could all work together to integrate thecharacters into the game and help each other in the debugging. For example, ifthree children wanted to work on a game of Space Invaders, they might split upthe three characters, aliens, hero and bullets among them. Then, when thebehaviors have been completed, they can all work together to place thecharacters in the game. When they begin to play, each might notice some bugs orstrange effects and go back and fix them. </p><h6 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>How do they assign permissions?</h6><p class=MsoBodyText>Permissions come into play when a child wishes to create anew object. There are many different types of permission structures. Forexample, in an object-oriented environment, a child may have seen some otherinteresting object in the system and want to make their own version. Whodetermines whether a child should be allowed to look inside anotherperson&#8217;s object? The object could be controlled by no one, in an opensystem, or by the owner of the object, usually its creator. A child might noteven need to open up an object in order to copy or subclass it. Again, theowner might allow or deny this attempt to examine the object. Generally, it isprobably a good idea to let children get practice arbitrating their own privacyand permission issues, since these are pervasive policy questions in the adultworld.</p><h6 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>How do they communicate to eachother while they are working? </h6><p class=MsoBodyText>There are several modes of communication available in anetworked environment. The simplest is a small IRC-like chat window at thebottom of the screen where children can send messages back and forth. A moreintegrated system might take the form of a MOO, where textual interactions withother users and objects are the dominant working mode.  If asynchronouscommunication is desired, one could support email or a public bulletin boardsystem where children can ask each other questions and get answers. Oneinteresting implementation of a bulletin board is an electronic white board.Every person gets a pen and can write messages to each on a shared graphicalboard. Taking this one step further, in a truly shared virtual world, all ofthe children get a mouse pointer and may manipulate shared objects inreal-time. Since there is only one world, all children would be able to viewany piece of it whenever they wanted. Thus, they could use the world to leavemessages or objects that they have created for each other.</p><h6 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'>How do children publish andadvertise their finished projects?</h6><p class=MsoBodyText>On many systems, designers have taken care to manage theircollaborative worlds to foster a sense of community between the users. Thisincludes providing opportunities to show off children&#8217;s work andproviding the means to expose children to things that they normally wouldn&#8217;thave come across. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Every winter in MOOSE Crossing, there is a public petshow, where children who have created new an interesting pet objects come toshow them off. This usually leads to a flurry of new construction activitywhere everyone tries to integrate the new and interesting features that theyhave seen into their own pet projects. While the pet show sparks some newactivity, the more common social conversations on the system also provide ideasto children from each other. When one child comes to another and says,&#8220;Look at my new pet purple ostrich!&#8221; a link is formed through whichideas, feedback and suggestions may flow.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In Kansas, whenever anyone makes a big enough mistake intheir program to crash the system, all of the users are transported together toOz where they can work together to fix the problem. The users might not haveknown each other otherwise, but in these times of crisis, people may worktogether to fix someone&#8217;s project (Smith, Wolczko, Ungar, 1997).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>The WWW created a new form of public bulletin board forpublishing projects. Since a net connection is quite cheap, and most schoolshave already been wired up to the Internet, children can get their own homepage without difficulty. Suitable construction media, such as Cocoa or Java,and now Bongo, allow programs to run inside web browsers. Children may usethese tools to construct various projects and show them to the world. Whilemost children&#8217;s web pages aren&#8217;t heavily trafficked, enough peoplewill stop by and give comments on the projects and offer suggestions forimprovements. This kind of anonymous feedback is very interesting. It mighteven be taken more seriously than feedback from a person the child knowsbecause this anonymous person could be an &#8220;expert&#8221; inproject&#8217;s domain.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc388971373">4.2.1.2<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Construction KitExamples</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>Examples help the user figure out the syntax and semanticsof your particular system, as well as show them examples of good style andsuccessful designs of projects (Fischer, 1993). It is also easier to modifyexisting projects when you are learning than to come up with new ideas on yourown. For example, 6.001, the introductory computer science class at MIT,teaches freshman and sophomore students about programming by asking them tomodify or complete partially written programs. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>How many examples should be distributed with theconstruction kit? How are they distributed? Are they modifiable? Can someoneopen them and understand how they were created? Examples can be packaged eitheras components in a library or pre-built projects. How many components shouldship in the library? If the design space of this construction kit allows wideranging exploration, then a library with just few sample objects for eachcategory in the design space should be sufficient. But how much is enough? Iftoo many components are in the library, the users might feel lost in a sea ofpossibilities. At this point, the organization of the components becomescritical. Components should be organized in multiple hierarchies, not just byobject type. Users should be able to search through the component sets andeasily find what they need.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>How are the example projects distributed? Usually, mostconstruction kit designers would include a few pre-built examples with theirkits. However, with the rise of the Internet and the WWW as a free publishingmedium, many designers have started to put new and updated projects on Webpages. Interested programmers can surf to these pages and download them. Thispublishing medium gives the kit creator the ability to update and add new examplesover time, and it allows the programmer to gain access to new and interestingprojects. Programmers can even use the Web as a transfer medium to tradeprojects with each other. Klik and Play and The Game Factory have a Webbulletin board where children not only share finished projects, but also helpeach other find and fix bugs. In addition, the public pooling of knowledgeabout programming techniques is valuable for beginners and experiencedprogrammers alike. Kit designers can also use this medium as a way to getfeedback on their example projects and distribution techniques.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In 1994, the 6.270 LEGO Robot Design competition wasstarted by Fred Martin and Randy Sargent. Students, undergraduates includingmyself, had to build Robo-Pirates. These robots had to capture pirate treasure(pick up foam blocks) and drink pirate punch (pick up sawed off plastic sodabottles). Students could take either a defensive strategy by collecting theirown treasure and punch, or take an offensive strategy, and raid the otherpirate&#8217;s treasure. Most people started out with their own ideas aboutwhat to do. A few days into the contest however, one team created a robot thatran around to the back of its own pirate ship, and one by one, knocked thebottles into its basket. As soon as everyone saw this, 20 teams switched theirstrategies to this one. Only five teams remained on any offensive strategy, andeventually one of these won the contest. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Students in this contest were easily swayed to makingsimple modifications on one simple strategy, rather than branching off to makeunique projects. While modifying standard projects can be a great learningactivity, it stifles creativity if the design experience does not provideopportunity to create more than one iteration of a project. Had the students inthe contest the opportunity to try it again, more of them would haveinvestigated offensive strategies.</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022539"></a><aname="_Toc386022606"></a><a name="_Toc386188507"></a><a name="_Toc387909821"></a><aname="_Toc387913313"></a><a name="_Toc388971374">4.2.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Programming Environment</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>The programming environment of a game construction kit isthe place where the user encounters the metaphors, functionality, and style ofuse that are appropriate for their task. There are some fundamental questionsto ask that determine the course of the environment. The following sectionsgive a small discussion of each issue and touch upon some advantages anddisadvantages of different approaches.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022540"></a><aname="_Toc386022607"></a><a name="_Toc387909822"></a><a name="_Toc387913314"></a><aname="_Toc388971375">4.2.2.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What can you make with it?</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>What can you make with the system? How much can it do?This is ultimately tied into the architecture of the kit, whether it isgeneral-purpose or domain-specific. There is no black and white distinctionbetween these two, however. Each construction kit can exist on a continuumbetween low-level and high-level programming. Often, the designer of such a kitmust help build a bridge from the bottom level implementation details of asystem to the high-level domain-specific knowledge that the user will have. Thereal issue is how far to make each side go before deciding where exactly on thebridge they will meet.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>General-purpose programming environments allow users andprogrammers to explore many personally meaningful domains of interest withoutgetting in their way. Traditional programming languages, like C, Lisp, Logo,and Smalltalk are general-purpose enough to allow programmers to writeapplications in any domain that want. Some even provide enough flexibility todefine themselves recursively! These languages are also Turing complete, whichmeans that they can compute anything that any possible Turing machine (orprogram) can compute.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Even though the designer of a general-purpose environmentonly has a limited idea of what to do with it, it may be used in many moredomains. This gives programmers enough flexibility to create anything that theywant to make, instead of limiting themselves to the environments&#8217;authors&#8217; imaginations. With this flexibility, however, comes sometradeoffs. Since these environments enable programmers to explore a very largedesign space, it becomes easy to get lost without any guidance. Usually,programmers must have a good idea of the type of project that they want tocreate before they sit down at the computer. Exploratory environments like Logoand Smalltalk make the conceptual development of a project easier by supportinginteractive development.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another technique for easing the cognitive burden ingeneral-purpose construction kits is to create a situated subset environment,or <i>microworld</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, in which the programmercan explore interesting ideas and problems (Papert, 1980). This new environmentis limited enough to be explored completely, but complex enough to give theuser a sense of understanding of powerful ideas. But, one should not create toomany microworlds and present them all to the user as parts of a largergeneral-purpose kit. Lisp, to pick one example, has extended itself to match anumber of specialized high-level domains. Due to this, it is more of a wholesystem than simple language. As more and more functionality is layered uponLisp, the whole system gets more and more complicated, the documentation getslonger and longer, and the whole system becomes more difficult to learn(Hutchins, et. al. 1986)</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>A domain-specific programming environment provides toolsto support more in-depth exploration in a specific set of topics than ageneral-purpose kit. Good domain-specific embedded programming environmentsallow the programmer to deal with only the content of their work and not bebothered with the mechanics of the environment (Fischer, 1993). If one isdesigned well, each of its metaphors will be intuitive enough to a personskilled in the application&#8217;s domain. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>A good example of one of these kits is MacromediaDirector. Specifically designed for creating movies, animations, andpresentations, Director is highly specialized for the video domain. It containsa programming language called Lingo which is designed to make scheduling andcoordination between many different media streams not just possible, but easy. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another interesting domain-specific toolkit is SAGE(Storytelling Agent Generation Environment) (Umaschi, 1997). SAGE allowschildren to created embedded communication models of turn-taking-basedstorytelling conversations. Children can script a conversation between thecomputer and another child about any topic. SAGE&#8217;s programmingenvironment allows children to create characters and describe them, create the conversationstructure in a graphical form, and write stories and record them in their ownvoices. One interesting piece of the environment is the conversation editor. Ituses a state diagram metaphor to control conversation flow between thestoryteller, a story assistant and the user. State transitions or communicationactions are illustrated by arrows between the states.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Domain-specific languages are great to use when youdon&#8217;t want the user to have to decompose their high level intentions intoa long series of low-level actions in order to accomplish a task. Since theauthor of the environment has knowledge about their programming domain, theymay write the program to take on the task of translating these high-levelstructures and concepts into the low-level details for the user. However, theauthor of a kit must watch out that the system doesn&#8217;t get toooverspecified. &#8220;Beware the over-specialized system where operations areeasy, but little of interest is possible&#8221; (Hutchins, et. al, 1986). Asystem that becomes over-specific loses what little generality it had and onlybecomes useful in situations for which the author has provided support. Userintentions that don&#8217;t decompose into actions supported by the kit couldbecome very hard to achieve, if not impossible. </p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc388971376">4.2.2.2<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Interpreted orCompiled</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>Is the environment in which the game is created the sameenvironment in which it is played? If so, then the process of game developmentchanges, as well as the possibilities for the environment&#8217;s use when theproject is done. If not, then the environment behaves more like traditionalcompiled programming environments. (Note: I am using the terms interpreted andcompiled not as references to the mechanics of the underlying languageimplementation, but as references to certain styles of programming. Interpretedstands in for interactive development, and compiled stands in for batch-styledevelopment where the compile/run cycle is not instantaneous.)</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In an interpreted programming environment a child canactively explore different options and see how these choices might affect theoutcome of the game. These environments should have support for undo and redooperations which make the price for any program change drop to almost nothing (Fischer and Lemke, 1987-88). Since the line between the program world and theruntime world is blurred, the programmer may use the environment as alaboratory, testing and playing with each piece separately, even before it isworked into the final project.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>A good example of an interpreted environment is Logo. Logocarried the concept of the Lisp Listener to the kids&#8217; realm and allowedchildren to try out their commands interactively. When there was a problem, aninteractive debugger could be invoked to help find the source of the bug. Inaddition, once the Logo turtle was introduced, children had a way to see thedirect effect of their programs as they were run. If there was a problem in atriangle drawing routine, they could easily see the incorrect behavior as theturtle moved around on the screen. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Once a game is &#8220;finished&#8221; in a interpretedenvironment, nothing more must be done to make it playable. This means that theprogramming environment is carried along with each project. If a program has abug, the child can debug it wherever it is being used, regardless of where itwas created. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another advantage of keeping the development environmentwith the finished product is support for extensibility. A game may be modifiedat anytime and examined by anyone. If children were working on their own games,they could examine someone else&#8217;s game to see how it was created and whatkinds of algorithms it used. If the children liked a particular character, theymight even be able to copy that character into their own game! Alex Repenninghas a working version of a trading post on the Web where children can swapagents for their Agentsheets programs. Sometimes it is very interesting to seewhat happens when a piano agent is dropped in a fish tank project. Will thefish ignore the piano? Or will they try to play some jazzy tune?</p><p class=MsoBodyText>By contrast, a compiled programming environment implies adifferent design style. For example, in a programming environment like Pascal,programmers must conceptualize large chunks of their program and write themdown all at once. Then they can compile what they&#8217;ve written and test itout in a separate play environment. Children can identify bugs and problems inthis environment, but must switch back to the development environment to makechanges because the run-time environment is not modifiable. Since it is noteasy to test out different modules before they are integrated into the wholeprogram (professional programmers use stubs for this), children must spendsignificant amounts of time planning ahead. When there is such a large time andenergy price in the compile/debug cycle, unbounded exploration is curtailed.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909826"></a><aname="_Toc387913318"></a><a name="_Toc388971377">4.2.2.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Direct Manipulation</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>Direct manipulation interfaces allow users to interactwith a system through metaphors that match the way that one thinks about thesystem. Instead of using text-based commands to manipulate objects on thescreen, a mouse can be used to drag icons representing these objects around.MacOS and Windows 95 both have direct manipulation desktop metaphors for theirfile systems which allow users to think of files and directories directly asicons and folders on the graphical desktop. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Ben Schneiderman, the researcher who coined the phrase&#8220;direct manipulation,&#8221; stipulated that these interfaces all havethree properties: continuous representation of the object of interest, physicalactions or labeled button presses instead of complex syntax, and rapid,incremental, reversible operations whose impact on the object of interest isimmediately visible (Schneiderman, 1982).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>The first real direct manipulation interface wasintroduced by Sutherland in 1963. His Sketchpad, a graphical design systemwhere people could &#8220;converse rapidly through the medium of linedrawing,&#8221; was a landmark because it was the first use of graphicalinterfaces, pointing devices, and the use of the screen as a sheet of paper(Sutherland, 1963). However, due to hardware limitations, it took about 20years before anyone else could do anything significant with graphical directmanipulation interfaces. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Since then, many advances have been made in the field,many of which have manifested themselves as commercial products. Many of theconstruction kits mentioned in the Chapter Three make extensive use of directgraphical interfaces to make metaphors more clear to the user. BillBudge&#8217;s Pinball Construction Set was one of the first construction kitsfor PCs in the mid 1980&#8217;s. It allowed people to move pinball game partsfrom a palette onto a blank pinball game. Users could customize their game withtheir own sets of bumpers and flashers that could themselves be reshaped by asimple tug of the mouse. Since there was a direct match between the graphicalkit and the problem domain, there were no syntax errors. If a part could not beplaced in a particular position, then it would not let itself be dropped there.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>The root of the cognitive argument for direct manipulationis to provide the user a sense of &#8220;directness&#8221; about the interfaceand their task. This is not a definable term, but through the exploration ofvarious examples which have been presented above, designers can get a feel forwhich metaphors are direct, and which are not. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>One key aspect of this directness is instant feedback.Direct manipulation interfaces should provide visual feedback for every stepthat the user takes in manipulating objects on the screen. In the MacOS whenthe user drags a file from one folder to another, a visual representation ofthe file moves with the mouse until the button is released and the file dropsinto its new folder.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another aspect should be direct engagement with theproblem domain. &#8220;Are we playing a game? Then we should be manipulatingdirectly the game world, touching and controlling the objects in that world,with the output of the system responding directly to our actions, and in a formcompatible with them&#8221; (Hutchins, et. al. 1986). Control interfaces tovideo games are another example of direct manipulation. A movement of ajoystick or a mouse sends characters in the game moving around in their virtualworld. This mapping of controller to character has been taken for granted inevery video game since Spacewar! Designers of game construction kits shouldthink carefully about the input modalities of a system to make them intuitiveand directly applicable to the games. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Sometimes, however, direct manipulation is not appropriate.For actions that induce abstract results, perhaps no mapping of physical orvirtual reality onto these domains would work. Applications that are inherently&#8220;invisible,&#8221; such as hidden state updates, might not be representedvery well by physical actions of the mouse. Repetitive operations, such assowing the field of pellets into Pac Man, can be quite tedious if no other formof abstract pellet &#8220;sprouting&#8221; is available. Direct manipulationinterfaces also do not lend themselves to accurate placement of objects on thescreen. Applications which require precise motion need to provide extraalternative approaches to tweaking the results to get the desired effects. Itisn&#8217;t easy to line up the aliens in Space Invaders without a ruler; amore clever mathematical approach uses div and mod to place each alien in itscorrect place within a block formation.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909827"></a><aname="_Toc387913319"></a><a name="_Toc388971378">4.2.2.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Abstraction</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>Any programming system must support abstraction andblackboxing in order to reduce complexity to a reasonable level. Human beingscan only think of several things at a time (Minsky, 1985). When people try tocomprehend a problem, they often break it up into subproblems that are easierto solve. If the programming language does not support this method of problemsolving, then users will quickly grow tired of the language and the problemitself. At the very least, the ability to name procedures and use them asbuilding blocks for other procedures is a requirement. There are severalimplementations of this black boxing in the kits discussed in Chapter Three:Logo, which uses procedural lambda calculus; Boxer, which uses graphical boxeson the screen to encapsulate procedures; and Robot Odyssey, which uses a chipburning metaphor to encapsulate a data flow circuit. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Data flow and instruction flow systems implement blackboxing in different ways. In data flow systems, black boxing enables the userto draw an interface around specific I/O ports and declare the new interface asa new basic block. One does have to be careful about documenting the I/O portsso the block does not have to be opened in order to be understood. In mosttraditional instruction flow architectures, a procedure is named, and separatedout with documentation that specifies what it does, what kind of inputs ittakes and what kind of outputs and side effects it produces.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In a video game construction kit, abstraction and blackboxing take on special meaning, since usually there are several different typesof characters that wish to share some common behaviors. These behaviors, ifreferred to in simple discrete blocks, are easily moved in and out ofcharacters. Creating discrete blocks with no dangling pointers, however, is noteasy and requires a lot of redesign. Care usually has to be taken that danglingpointers to other objects are capped with either the original objects, orinstructions telling how to attach a suitable replacement once the block entersthe new space.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022543"></a><aname="_Toc386022610"></a><a name="_Toc386188508"></a><a name="_Toc387909829"></a><aname="_Toc387913321"></a><a name="_Toc388971379">4.2.2.5<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Debugging</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>Debugging features have not been adequately thought out incurrent game construction kits. Debugging is still a major issue for theadvanced programmer community, so this state of affairs is not surprising. Whatshould the debugging features be and when should they be active and available?</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Different types of bugs include syntax bugs, logic bugs,and timing bugs. Syntax bugs are the easiest to fix. Usually the compiler orinterpreter can flag these down as they show up and point them out to theprogrammer. Often, the reason for the bug is known to the compiler and asuggested fix could be offered. (I hope someday for a compiler that fixes theseobvious bugs for you instead of forcing you to correct something as simple as amisplaced parenthesis.) Graphical programming helps to alleviate a lot ofsyntactical problems by eliminating the need for text syntax in the first place.The graphics can also provide context clues (i.e. holes for procedurearguments) about what kind of syntactic graphics can be placed in differentspots. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Logic bugs occur when the behavior of a running system isnot what was expected. Once the code is running and the characters are movingaround on the screen, perhaps you notice that the power pellet is eating PacMan instead of the other way around. Finding these logic bugs is easy when they are directly produced by a code error. However, in many cases, the bug mightcause a nested chain of events to occur that produce a visible bug much laterthan the original error.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>The timing bug is perhaps the most annoying of all bugs.When you have many characters on the screen that need to interactdeterministically, timing issues can really get in your way. If character A iswalking across the screen at 4 steps per second and character B is walking fromthe other side of the screen at 5 steps every other second, at what time does Aneed to start walking in order to make A meet B 3/4 of the way across thescreen on B&#8217;s side? Debugging these timing errors is difficult since thetools for debugging dynamic run-time information such as tracing or insertingprint statements alter the timing of the very code you&#8217;re trying to test!</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In either interpreted or compiled programmingenvironments, the ability to run an arbitrary piece of code with arbitraryinputs is very important in learning how a piece of code went wrong. In somecases you may want to &#8220;set up&#8221; a situation in which multiplecharacters are in a certain state, let the system go, and then watch it unfoldin order to find out where it went wrong. Perhaps a system that records allstate transitions and is able to play them back (data flow transitions +dynamic instruction flow transitions) would be useful. Football coaches tapescrimmages and games in order to reflect on them in a port-mortem attempt toidentify flaws and errors that weren&#8217;t noticed during play.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Sometimes you don&#8217;t want your debugging to stop therest of the system. It would be good if you could extract a malfunctioningcharacter from a game, examine it under &#8220;laboratory&#8221; conditions andput it back in the game when you&#8217;ve corrected the problem. You could alsouse these laboratory conditions to alter a particular creature&#8217;s behaviorin order to force a situation to occur. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Darwin&#8217;s Pond, by Jeffrey Ventrella, is a laboratoryfor evolving many-legged locomoting creatures. If you like, you can letevolution take its course and let the system self-select for the fastestcreature. But, if the budding scientist in you takes over, you may pluck acreature from the pond, tweak its genes in a beaker, and then put it back tospread the new genes throughout the gene pool.</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909830"></a><aname="_Toc387913322"></a><a name="_Toc388971380">4.2.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Programming Language</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>The programming model and language help shape theusers&#8217; cognitive models of the system. The first part of this sectiondiscusses different cognitive models of computation and how they affect theprograms that are written. The second section discusses the influence of graphicalprogramming on the game construction kit world. The third section explores thedifference between data flow and instruction flow languages and identifiessituations in which each is appropriate. The last section talks aboutobject-oriented programming and how this can help lower the threshold forunderstanding how a complicated video game might work.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022544"></a><aname="_Toc386022611"></a><a name="_Toc387909831"></a><a name="_Toc387913323"></a><aname="_Toc388971381">4.2.3.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Models of Computation</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>There are several different models of computation in usein the field of computer science today. While all of these are computationallyequivalent to the Turing machine, they afford the user different cognitivemodels that have direct influences on the types of programs that may becreated.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>The most basic model is the Turing machine. This modeluses a transition relation to define state changes in a program. Someconstruction kits, such as Cocoa and Agentsheets, use the Turing model as theirmodel of programming. To make a ball fall in space, the programmer simplydescribes the state transition from the ball in one position to one where theball occupies a position with lower potential energy. To make this modelcomplete, one might also include some hidden state showing how much kineticenergy is in the ball. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>One problem with the Turing model shows up when yourproblems get more complex. In a Turing machine, the more states you have, thebigger your transition relation. For every new object, new position, or hiddenstate, you need another state in your machine. There are 2<i><sup>n</sup></i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'><sup> </sup>entries in a complete transition relationwith </span><i>n</i><span style='font-style:normal'> states.  Clearly, thisblowup has many implications on the types of projects that can be created.Simple things which don&#8217;t have much state are easy to write. But, as soonas you make your model a little more complex, the number of transitions youhave to specify grows exponentially, and leads to cognitive and practicalintractability very quickly.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>One abstraction that improves the Turing machine isparameterized state. An example of this might be a predicate which says&#8220;if there is a ball to the left of me.&#8221; This predicate could easilystand in for quite a few states where the object in question could be in anyposition, with any internal state, as long as any ball is situated to the leftof it. AgentSheets&#8217; support for Visual AgenTalk is Repenning&#8217;simplementation of parameterized state machines, and in practice, affords a muchhigher level of control over the agents in the system.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Assembly language is the fundamental language of digitalcomputers. FUNdaMENTAL is a general-purpose construction kit that uses anextended assembly language model of programming. Conceived of and written byJustin Kitch, it was introduced as a way to allow children to build allabstractions by themselves. This technique was used as a way to maketransparent all of the computation steps that a high level language tries sohard to cover.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>There are several models of computation that can take overwhen you have many different elements in your game that act in parallel. SIMD(single instruction, multiple data), SPMD (single program, multipleinstruction, multiple data) and MIMD (multiple program, multiple instruction,multiple data) provide very good abstract models for parallel computing. SIMDallows the programmer to reason about single-threaded instruction flow thatacts on multiple objects. This is often called vector processing, since themultiple objects all tend to be related in some way. These multiple objectscould be characters in a game. Each character is programmed the same way withthe single program, though since they could have different internal state atany point they might appear to act differently. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>The SIMD model is appropriate for parallel proceduralprogramming. When you add in object-orientation to the parallelism, however,MIMD programming becomes a better model. MIMD models the same multiple objects,but each object executes its own program at its own pace, rather than allexecuting in lockstep. Object-oriented approaches help alleviate thehierarchical pressure on the structure of the program by providing convenientinterface and black boxes around abstractions.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>SPMD is a simpler version of the MIMD model that enablesdifferent processes to execute independently, but removes theobject-orientation from the system. This allows the programmer to write onelarge program that all processes may share. This model is good for theparallelization of procedural programming languages like Logo ifobject-orientation is not desired.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022545"></a><aname="_Toc386022612"></a><a name="_Toc386022549"></a><a name="_Toc386022616"></a><aname="_Toc387909837"></a><a name="_Toc387913329"></a><a name="_Toc388971382">4.2.3.2<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Graphical orTextual Programming?</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>In the 1970&#8217;s, most games were written in assemblylanguage and had to fit into very tight memory constraints. These games alsorequired special video hardware to support this highly space efficient code. Inthe 1980&#8217;s, professional games were still being coded in assembly, butauthors started turning to C and more platform-independent text programminglanguages. Once the PC was firmly entrenched, video game construction kits(which themselves were written in Assembler and C) started to appear. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>The first kits embodied the same textual programming styleas their authors preferred. Logo was a popular one for kids. They could programturtles to move around the screen and interact with each other. UsingLogoWriter, kids could easily program simple shoot-em-up games with rudimentarysprite graphics. Since the code was in text form, children had to master syntax(already reduced in difficulty due to Logo&#8217;s designers), understanding ofprocedures, and the interpretation of system events in text form. MicroWorlds,the latest incarnation of Logo from LCSI, improves the graphics, sound, multimediaand parallelism of LogoWriter, and enables children to easily create good videogames.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Since Logo, there have been quite a few game constructionkits that moved toward a more graphical programming style. The early kits ranon the Apple II with limited resolution graphics and used joysticks for apointer. Users could choose from many different metaphors for programming, butone of the popular kits, Rocky&#8217;s Boots, involved wiring up circuits. Kidscould connect up wires between inputs and outputs and see the resulting programas a large circuit. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Other types of graphical programming involved translatingtextual languages to a graphical form to reduce syntactical programmingdifficulties. Logo was translated to LogoBlocks (Begel, 1996) in this way; eachprimitive was turned into a toy block on the screen that could be draggedaround and snapped together to form a program. If a primitive needed to take anargument, there would be a hole in the block in which the argument would be thecorrect shape to fit. While removing the syntactical problems of programming,it still retained the sequential programming style of a textual programminglanguage, though since programs could flow in two dimensions, branchingprogramming flow was better revealed. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another way to translate the textual programming intographical form was Agentsheets, where the primitive blocks could be droppedinto a stimulus-response block to build up rules. Each stimulus-response blockcould be dropped into another one, supporting hierarchy and nesting.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>One of the latest forms of graphical programming in gameconstruction kits is very object-oriented. Objects on the screen are containersfor their attributes, such as sounds, graphics, animations and movements. Theprogrammer can drag and drop new attributes on top of the object to give it newbehaviors. Movement behaviors are illustrated by-example, where the user candraw a path for the object to follow, or are programmatically represented bydefining simple motions with arrows. Collision behaviors, however, are notsupported well, since there are <i>n<sup>2</sup></i><span style='font-style:normal'> interactions between </span><i>n</i><span style='font-style:normal'>characters. In this container-style environment, it is also not clear in whichobject these interaction relations should reside. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another unresolved problem is the issue of debugging agraphical program. Graphical debugging tools are almost nonexistent, and thosethat do exist are in very primitive states, utilizing very little graphics anda lot of text. Are teachers able to look at students&#8217; work to quickly seethe problem and offer help? In addition, it is unclear whether graphicalprogramming gives the programmer an enhanced understanding of program flow,data flow, or the operation of their program in any real sense. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Graphical programming has its flaws, but current researchin the field offers many promises. Textual programming is still here to stay,however, which is why many researchers are now looking into hybridtext/graphics programming environments that try to incorporate the best aspectsof each.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909838"></a><aname="_Toc387913330"></a><a name="_Toc388971383">4.2.3.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Data Flow or Instruction Flow?</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>Most textual programs follow an instruction flowarchitecture. Sequences of code are written to be evaluated in order. Theconditionals and procedure calls form the dynamic instruction scheduling of theprogram, so the key to understanding it is through tracing the control flow.Some graphical environments also present instruction flow models. Often, theseare just graphical translations of textual programming languages, but othersuse the graphical nature to their advantage to help illustrate control flowthrough the program using tree structures on the screen. In addition, while theprogram is running, instruction flow can be illustrated by highlighting piecesof the program as the computation reaches them. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Data flow, on the other hand, has been used in limitedcases in the textual world, usually through spreadsheets, where cells arelinked to each other via equations. Systems that solve constraint equations arealso modeling data flow. However, data flow works well in the graphical world.Borrowing from a circuit metaphor, programmers can connect computation blockstogether via wires to create a data flow network. The direction of the wiresdetermines the constraints in the program&#8217;s flow. Each computation blockmay either be a sequential computation or may be part of the I/O system. Forinstance, in Robot Odyssey, children program the robot&#8217;s head byconnecting sensor inputs to motor outputs via wires. Along the way might beseveral computation blocks, like digital logic gates, which can control thedata flowing through the wires.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In instruction flow, it is often hard to track data valuesor state variables as they change through the computation. Often, these statevariables can be affected by numerous sources throughout the code, which makesquestions like &#8220;how did that <i>xcor</i><span style='font-style:normal'>get to be 5?&#8221; difficult to answer. Data flow helps alleviate this problemby making visible all of the factors that can affect a state variable or anyother piece of the calculation. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>Data flow also helps to present parallel execution. Bymerely expressing the constraints between the data values and not the controlflow, the system is free to execute any part of the program at any time as longas the constraints are met. While this makes it difficult to visualize thealgorithmic flow of the program, it alleviates the programmer and the kitimplementor from having to state a specific ordering for an inherently parallelcomputation. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Instruction flow, though, has its own method for dealingwith parallel constructs. If each program were represented by a stack of blockswhich execute sequentially, the parallel program could be represented by ageometrically parallel array of these stacks. These parallel stacks also fitthe object-orientation model, since each stack could reside in the object thatit affects! </p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022551"></a><aname="_Toc386022618"></a><a name="_Toc387909839"></a><a name="_Toc387913331"></a><aname="_Toc388971384">4.2.3.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Object-Oriented Programming</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>The question of programming style is also an open one inthe programming community. Lisp started the procedural style of programming asan implementation of the lambda calculus. It is a convenient style forexpressing mathematical functions and for expressing program flow in functionalstyle. All action takes place in disembodied procedures that take arguments asinputs on which to specialize their action. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Object-oriented programming started with SmallTalk, andputs the procedures inside the objects for which they are associated. Insteadof having <i>walk</i><span style='font-style:normal'> and </span><i>run</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> functions that only check their input for what to dowith a </span><i>human </i><span style='font-style:normal'>or a </span><i>dog,</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> </span><i>walk</i><span style='font-style:normal'>and </span><i>run</i><span style='font-style:normal'> are embedded inside thecreatures that support them. </span><i>Dog</i><span style='font-style:normal'>and </span><i>human</i><span style='font-style:normal'> can now be containersfor those methods.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>Container-based programming in object-oriented style issemantically equivalent to procedural programming and can be reduced to lambdacalculus. But it does give many affordances to the programmer&#8217;s mentalmodel of computation. Any object can be a container for some variables and somemethods. This fits the style of most video game construction sets, since thecharacters in the game have some attributes and know how to perform certaintasks. Most video game construction sets are object-oriented in this way. In agame kit, objects might be implemented with two public methods: <i>time-step</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> and </span><i>display</i><span style='font-style:normal'>. A global clock would send each object a </span><i>time-step</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> message and the object would update its internalstate. Then a </span><i>display</i><span style='font-style:normal'> messagewould be sent and any objects that had modified their visible state would beredrawn.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another benefit to object-oriented programming isinheritance. Since <i>dog</i><span style='font-style:normal'> and </span><i>human</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> both know how to </span><i>walk</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> and </span><i>run</i><span style='font-style:normal'>,they could both inherit these methods from a </span><i>mammal</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> that knows how to do both. The methods arecustomized, of course, to use each instances&#8217; unique form of locomotion.This is called shadowing, and lets each instance override methods inheritedfrom its parent.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>Object-oriented programming helps reduce complexity byadding hierarchy, modularity and abstraction. Objects can choose to betransparent or opaque and expose as much or as little of their internalstructure as they want to the world.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>One area in which OO programming breaks down is in theinterfaces between objects. When two objects collide and interact, where do themethods that control their behaviors go? In a symmetric interaction, thereshould be only one procedure to describe this. But, in an asymmetric encounter,different behaviors might be programmed for whether the object ran intoanother, or was run into by another.</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022553"></a><aname="_Toc386022620"></a><a name="_Toc386188510"></a><a name="_Toc387909840"></a><aname="_Toc387913332"></a><a name="_Toc388971385">4.2.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Game Structure</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>This section talks about the structure of the games thatcan be built by children.

And how are inputevents handled by the system? </p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909841"></a><aname="_Toc387913333"></a><a name="_Toc388971386">4.2.4.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>What Kind of Video Game?</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>With all of the discussion centered around issues inconstruction kit design, it might be easy to overlook the actual reason forcreating the construction kit. The purpose is to create video games. But whatis a video game? Are there different types? What will the scope of the kit be?</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In Chapter Three, there was a discussion of severaldifferent construction kits, both general-purpose and game specific. If wecould define what kinds of video games we are talking about, we might get abetter idea about what specific features should be included.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>There are several different types of video games, rangingfrom the original Pong-like arcade games of the 1960&#8217;s and 1970&#8217;sto the current Doom and Diablo. We can actually categorize games based on theirchronology. Arcade games were first, beginning with SpaceWar! Video arcadesgrew up around the culture of playing video games and in the late 1970&#8217;sand early 1980&#8217;s this new culture took off. A new generation of children,including myself, grew up playing Space Invaders, Pac Man and Frogger. Oneparticular favorite of mine was Moon Buggy, where you had to drive a moon roveralong a bumpy landscape and avoid getting caught in the craters. These gameshelped kids develop a lot of hand-eye coordination, but did not do much fortheir mental agility.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>The home gaming market took off with the Atari 2600 andcontinued with Nintendo&#8217;s game kit. This kit introduced the world to theMario Brothers, who were to star in every version of Nintendo&#8217;s game kit,even up until today. With Nintendo, game designers could make goal-orientedvideo games. The Legend of Zelda was a particularly good game, where you had tomaneuver your character through mazes and enemies to find the six crystals andput them together to defeat the evil Ganon. These games consisted of manydifferent levels, each one bringing their own challenges. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>The next type of game, the role-playing game, or RPG, wasoriginally a personal role-playing game where several people would get togetherand take characters through an adventure moderated by a dungeon master. Ultimabrought this game to the Apple II and enabled players to roll many differentcharacters and play games over and over again without the hassle of findingother people or a dungeon master to play along. Players had their group ofcharacters explore a fantasy environment to kill creatures for gold andexperience. With enough experience, characters went up in levels and couldlearn new skills. These games took advantage of the general-purposecomputer&#8217;s power to create truly complex games that took many hours towin.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>For a long time, Nintendo and RPG games were justvariations of earlier ones. But in 1991, Doom was introduced by Id Software.This was the first first-person viewpoint 3D adventure game. It combined great3D graphics, rendering, and animation with a shoot-em-up atmosphere that swepthomes across the country. Currently, the most popular game of this type isQuake, which added networking features so people could play each other fromtheir own houses.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Game construction kits co-evolved with these games. Soonafter the first games came out on the personal computer, Bill Budge introducedhis very popular Pinball Construction Set. Allowing children to create theirown pinball games proved very popular, since kids could customize their owngame and show off their creativity to their friends. Recently, Klik and Play,by Maxis, came out to enable kids to program their own real Nintendo-stylevideo games. Soon, Europress Inc. will come out with The Game Factory 3D, atoolkit for creating Doom-like games.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022533"></a><aname="_Toc386022600"></a><a name="_Toc387909842"></a><a name="_Toc387913334"></a><aname="_Toc388971387">4.2.4.2<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Storyboarding or Instant Play?</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>While the programming of games is much simplified withconstruction kits, the task of figuring out what to make is still difficult.Nintendo style games include so many levels, characters and story lines that achild needs to be an accomplished writer to come up with everything. How canthis cognitive load be lessened, or if not, how can the kit support complexstoryboarding?</p><p class=MsoBodyText>First, let&#8217;s assume there are two types of gamesthat the child wants to create: the shoot-em-up game and the Nintendo-stylegame. A construction kit may support one or both of these types of games. Ashoot-em-up game requires thinking about a scenario and a background for thecharacters in the game. Perhaps the toolkit could provide suggestive componentsin its library or sample projects that could lead the child to creating certaintypes of games. Having a library filled with space ships and aliens would leadnaturally to space adventures where the characters can shoot and kill aliensfor points. One or two games could be represented in the library, which wouldprovide enough direction for the child to easily come up with ideas for games,but wouldn&#8217;t stifle any creative ideas the child may get when they wantto combine ideas from different sources into a mosaic game. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>If a Nintendo-style goal-oriented game is desired, thenthere are issues like storyboarding, scenery, and character developmentinvolved. Before a child even sits down at the computer, they should bethinking about the game and what they would like in it. Is there a hero on aquest to save a princess? Is there gold and glory to be had? What is the reasonfor a person to play this game? What puzzles and challenges await the heroalong the way? How are these puzzles organized? Must they be completed inorder, or can the hero pick and choose the easiest ones to solve first? Arethere any special tools or magic items that can help the character out duringits quest? Are there any enemies or aliens to fight and get in the hero&#8217;sway? </p><p class=MsoBodyText>A construction kit could provide some storyboardingsupport for children who wish to design their game in front of the computer.Macromedia Director contains a type of storyboarding tool which uses a filmbased metaphor to scripts scenes and segues. Artificial intelligence systemshave used thematic role frames to help computers understand scripted actions. Aform of these could be used by the child to script major events in a storyline. Then, the computer could help the child fill in the required detailsalong the way.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>A painting system might be required for users to painttheir own scenery in the game. Each screen of the game may contain similarscenery, so perhaps a morphing or graphical mutation system might be includedto slightly alter each screen with respect to another. SimCity and Populous allowusers to design their own landscape, complete with mountains, plains, riversand oceans. Populous takes the metaphor that the author is a god, and can makemountains rise from the seas, or cause groundbreaking earthquakes to make thedesired landscapes.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>A goal oriented kit should also support large-scaleproduction. Games like Legend of Zelda are not small; they involve scores ofscenes, and many different transitions. If a kit supported scene cloning, orrandom monster generation, a child could concentrate on the story line and notget bogged down in boring details.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022538"></a><aname="_Toc386022605"></a><a name="_Toc387909843"></a><a name="_Toc387913335"></a><aname="_Toc388971388">4.2.4.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>One Player or Many Players?</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>A multi-player game requires more ingenuity of design thana single-player game. Obviously, the controls for the game need to beduplicated or extended to support the second player. A more subtle problemmight be synchronization between different characters and different playerstrying to affect them.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Where do the players physically reside? They can eitherall play at one computer, or play at many computers. If they are on onecomputer, they must contend for resources. There is only one mouse, onejoystick and one keyboard. Often, each player will get a few keys on thekeyboard to themselves. Are the keys customizable? </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Playing on multiple computers requires networking support.It brings up questions of where the game lives. Is it client-server based, oris it distributed? In games like Quake and Diablo, there is a central serverhosted by the game manufacturer that is a clearinghouse for distributedlocalized game servers. Your version of Diablo connects to the main server tofind out where a local server is and then connects to the local one to join thegame. dMOO, a distributed MOO from Intel explores object architecture issues indistributed systems. User&#8217;s objects may contain several replicated copiesthat exist on many servers. Actions that affect each object are transmittedthrough to each copy in a lazy consistency model. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>How much interaction will the players have? If multiplepeople are in the world, the object might be creative collaborativeconstruction, as in MOOSE Crossing. It might be Diablo&#8217;s model, whereplayers can band together to kill monsters, or kill each other. Is it easy forkids to design games that require collaboration? This question remains to beexplored.</p><h4 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909844"></a><aname="_Toc387913336"></a><a name="_Toc388971389">4.2.4.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Environmental Events</a></h4><p class=MsoBodyText>Once the programming paradigms have been chosen, howshould the system react to the player? In most video games, the interactioncomes from a joystick, mouse, keyboard, or network. The system can either embedthese interactions in an interaction object, or the user could embed theseinteractions in each object that needs to react to them. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>It makes sense to embed procedures inside objects. Butwhat happens when the object causing the interaction is not &#8220;in&#8221;the game? External events come in asynchronously and affect the characters ofthe game. If the characters don&#8217;t expect them, then the action couldinterrupt whatever they might be doing at the time. If characters instead pollfor the events, they will never be interrupted unless they are ready to receivean event.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>The event could be embedded inside its own&#8220;breed&#8221; of objects. When a key-up event comes in, it might affecttwo or three different characters. Inside the event, there must be severalplaces to identify the characters to that will be affected and what to do tothem. This approach, while linking the action to the effect, in factdisembodies the effect from the characters it is affecting. There is alsoanother disadvantage. A key-up event and a joystick-up event should rightly gointo separate objects, but they might have the same semantic effect on thecharacters of the game. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>The other approach is to embed the event polling insidethe character that wishes to receive it. If the system notices an event comesin, on the next <i>time-step</i><span style='font-style:normal'> message, itwould include an event. If the key-up event came into the character and thecharacter wished to respond, it could do anything it wanted. All characterswould receive their own key-up notification at the same time, and all effectswould be localized to the character which they were affecting.  This optionallows the kit designer to abstract the lexically different events intosemantic groupings and provide the characters with ways to recognize thesesemantic groups. This reduces duplication of code and brings the programmercloser to the semantic meaning of the program they are writing.</span></p></div><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Times'><br clear=ALLstyle='page-break-before:always'></span><div class=Section6><h1 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909845"></a><aname="_Toc387913337"></a><a name="_Toc388971390">5.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Bongo: Video Game Construction Kit</a></h1><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022554"></a><aname="_Toc386022621"></a><a name="_Toc386188511"></a><a name="_Toc387909846"></a><aname="_Toc387913338"></a><a name="_Toc388971391">5.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Overview</a></h2><p class=MsoBodyText>Now that many of the design considerations for creatingconstruction kits for children have been enumerated and discussed, is itpossible to create a construction kit that has all or many of the desirablequalities? This chapter describes a design and implementation for a video gameconstruction kit that was designed around the discussion from the previouschapter and attempts to achieve the seven goals of understandability,uniformity and elegance, interactivity, functionality, transparency, powerfulideas, and reflection and audience.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>This video game kit&#8217;s scope includes Atari 2600style arcade games, like Pac Man, Frogger and Space Invaders. There are othergame construction kits which attempt a broader scope to make Nintendo andDoom-like games, but we feel that there is enough creative design space openfor children to make very interesting arcade games. In addition, since arcadegames usually don&#8217;t get very complex, they would give an easy-to-learngame model that could be modified easily.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>The video game kit produces standalone web pages with thegames inside. This allows kids to publish their games on the Web, and allowsother children to use them and share them. This publication takes place on acentral server, so children can easily get access to a large quantity of sampleprojects and projects created by other children for inspiration and help intheir own games. Currently, game design takes place off-line and involves oneor more children sitting in front of one computer. In the future, this toolkitcould be attached to a web site, and children who surf by will be able to notonly play, but also create their own games on-line.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>The programming environment for the video game toolkit isa text/graphics hybrid. Drag and drop is used in the high-level movement ofobjects in the interface, but text-based procedural programming in the VideoGame StarLogo language is used for programming behaviors for the characters ina game. There also is a command center, where users can interactively try outcommands with their characters and see the results run instantly. This makesthis kit very similar in feel to Logo. But it is more domain-specific, since itallows users to easily create breeds of characters that can respond to the userand execute code on every clock-tick. It is not so specific, however, that itcould not be used for normal Logo or StarLogo programming. Actually, this kitmerely implements a different interface to the StarLogo kernel. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Object-orientation is very important in the design of thiskit. It uses a container-based form of object-orientation, similar to Boxer,where most objects are containers for other things. For example, in the gamecharacter container, there are several sub-containers: a shape container, asound container, an event code container, a time-step code container, and anauxiliary code container. Each of those sub-containers holds other objects likeshapes, sounds and code. This container metaphor extends from the characters inthe game to the game itself. It is also a container that containsmeta-information about the game, like the score, the characters on theplayfield, and the instructions on how to run the game. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>The next section will describe the specific design detailsof the video game construction kit, starting with the characters of the game,moving through user interaction, and ending with the creation of a game.</p><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc388971392">5.2<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Design</a></h2><p class=MsoBodyText>This Bongo-based video game construction kit is based onStarLogo, a massively parallel version of Logo for children (Resnick, 1994). InStarLogo, kids program commands for many turtles to execute. Sometimes theturtles all do the same thing, but often, small differences in their positionsor internal state cause them to behave very differently from their fellows. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>This is also true in most video games. At the very least,the player&#8217;s avatar, or &#8220;hero,&#8221; responds to theplayer&#8217;s real-time commands; it is not just under algorithmic control. Inmany games such as Pac Man or Space Invaders, there is more than one type ofcharacter. StarLogo calls these <i>breeds</i><span style='font-style:normal'>.Different </span><i>breeds</i><span style='font-style:normal'> of turtles maybe controlled with different programs. In a Pac Man game, there would be fourbreeds: pac-man, ghosts, pellets, and power-pellets. In Space Invaders, thereare three breeds of characters: heroes, space invaders and bullets.  </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>Using these breeds, we have a way to differentiate amongthe different characters in the video game. The child should be able to furthercustomize the characters by setting their characteristics. One of theseattributes is the shape. Pac Man should look like a yellow pie with a wedge cutout. The ghost should look like a person wearing a sheet over their heads withholes cut out for their eyes. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>These shapes, however, might serve only for the defaultstate for the characters. Often, you want the character to look different whenit is in different states. While Pac Man is dying, his pie shape should turnupward, and its wedge should open wider and wider until the pie disappears. Thedefault shape of a character can appear as a guideline, but other shapes oranimations could be added into a shape container within the breed. Programmersare able to drag shapes from a shape palette into the shape container of thebreed, and drag them out again to remove them. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>In addition to shapes, a breed might have characteristicsounds to play when the character bumps into a wall or gobbles up a powerpellet. Thus, a sound container is also a part of the breed container. Thissound container could hold many different sounds that are characteristic to thebreed.</p><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><imgwidth=300 height=200 id="_x0000_i1025"src="begel-meng-thesis_files/image001.png"></p><p class=MsoCaption align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><aname="_Toc388939646">Figure </a>1: Preliminary Breed Editor</p><p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoBodyText>After the user has customized the visual and auralcomponents of the breed, they must finish customizing the other statevariables. Since a breed is a class of character and not an instance, theparticular values of the state variables don&#8217;t have much meaning exceptto serve as initial values for a new instance of that breed. Some statevariables that are relevant to turtles include their <i>x</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> and </span><i>y</i><span style='font-style:normal'>position, their </span><i>heading</i><span style='font-style:normal'>, their </span><i>pencolor</i><span style='font-style:normal'> and their current </span><i>shape</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'>. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>The breed&#8217;s behavior can be broken up into threeparts: response to events, the <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>time-step</span>action, and auxiliary functions. There are numerous types of events that mayoccur during game play such as mouse movements and key presses. Other events,like timing events, user-defined events, or even events generated by othercharacters might be supported as well. In many games, most of these events willnot be applicable, but the programmer can specify which ones to listen to. Theprogrammer can write some code that will determine what these characters dowhen those events occur. This code may call on any primitives in the language,or procedures that are contained within the auxiliary code container of thatbreed. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>When the event-driven code has been finished, the usermust specify what will happen on every <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>time-step</span> when there are no other events occurring.For instance, the ghosts in Pac Man wander around the screen randomly wheneverthey sense that Pac Man is far away. In Space Invaders, the Invaders march infile across and down the screen relentlessly until they are killed or untilthey reach the bottom of the screen. Again, the code in this section may callon any primitives or procedures that are contained within the auxiliary codecontainer. </p><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><imgwidth=414 height=434 id="_x0000_i1026"src="begel-meng-thesis_files/image002.png"></p><p class=MsoCaption align=center style='text-align:center'><aname="_Toc388939647">Figure </a>2: Video Game Playing Field</p><p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Once the breed has been defined completely, the programmermay create instances of the breed by dragging a copy of the breed from thebreed palette to the playing field. When the character has been created in thisway, it may be further customized by the programmer. Since the instance of thebreed is also a container (but one specific to this particular instance) it maybe opened up and examined. It contains an exact copy of all of the informationfrom the breed, but the information inside may be altered without affecting thebreed container, or any other instances of that breed. The user may choose tomove the character around on the screen, change its shape, or change itspersonal copy of the breed&#8217;s code.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>When all of the characters have been laid out on theplaying field, the user can customize the background by painting on it withpaint tools. They can also load in a GIF as a background image that would besuitable for their game. The characters in the game might be able to sense andreact or even modify the background while the game is in play. </p><p class=MsoNormal align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><imgwidth=248 height=204 id="_x0000_i1027"src="begel-meng-thesis_files/image003.png"></p><p class=MsoCaption align=center style='text-align:center;line-height:normal'><aname="_Toc388939648">Figure </a>3: Video Game Command Center</p><p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another important piece of the video game construction setis the command center. From here, the user can try out pieces of code, tell afew characters to run their <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>time-step</span>code, or even tell the game to begin. They can also use this window to runcommands on all of the characters in the playing field. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>In many games, a notion of score is useful to indicate tothe player about progress towards a goal. The scoreboard acts just like anyother global variable, except that it is a state variable contained within thegame itself. Thus, the playing field is also a container for some parts. Thiscontainer holds a representation of the background of the screen, thecharacters that are currently residing on it, the <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>score</span>, the <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>time-step</span> code (for the game, perhaps ticking aclock) which by default runs the <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>time-step</span> code of all the characters in the game, and anauxiliary code container. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>When the user has finished the entire game, he may playwith it in the testing environment, or he may press a button to generate astandalone version of the game that is available for any player to play. Thisbutton will auto-generate a web page with the game contained inside, and linkit to a web page residing on the server so that the game may be reached fromthe Web.</p><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022555"></a><aname="_Toc386022622"></a><a name="_Toc386188512"></a><a name="_Toc387909847"></a><aname="_Toc387913339"></a><a name="_Toc388971393">5.3<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Programming Language</a></h2><p class=MsoBodyText>While this document has mentioned quite a bit about thespecification for the video game construction set, not much attention has beengiven to the programming language in which the children will control thecharacters. Video Game StarLogo is a variant of StarLogo and includes the samesyntax and semantics. It also supports several new primitives to provide theuser with the ability to play sounds, change shapes and detect collisions betweencreatures due to their on-screen shapes.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>StarLogo is a parallel version of the Logo languagedeveloped by Mitchel Resnick. All of Logo&#8217;s turtle functionality ispreserved, but any instruction code applies for all living turtles. When theuser writes<span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'> fd 10</span>,all of the turtles go forward ten turtle steps. By the very fact that there areseveral hundred turtles around at any given time, this often leads to veryunLogo-like behavior. If all of the turtles were oriented in random directionsat the center of the screen, and you said <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>fd 10</span>, you would get a circle! (The locus of pointsequidistant from a center point form a circle.) This is StarLogo&#8217;spurpose. Parallel computing requires a new way of thinking about problems andsolutions. Resnick&#8217;s proposal is the &#8220;decentralized mindset&#8221;(Resnick, 1994). The best way to think about decentralized systems is toprogram them yourself in a decentralized manner. While all of your turtles runthe same source code, they execute it differently based on their local stateand the local interactions they experience. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>This SPMD model of computation may seem confusing, butthere are several techniques for making it easier to understand. The first isthat you can think of each turtle as an independent entity in the calculation.When you program each line of code, each turtle runs it in order. StarLogo doesnot support multithreading within individual turtles, so each turtle will neverhave synchronization problems with itself. If my turtle was a ghost in the gameof Pac Man, I would have him loop to check if Pac Man is around. If it wasaround, then the ghost should run after it and eat Pac Man. But, if the ghostis &#8220;afraid&#8221; because Pac Man just ate a power pellet, then it shouldrun away. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Another technique for controlling complexity isStarLogo&#8217;s <i>breed</i><span style='font-style:normal'> mechanism. Inorder to manage different classes of turtles, each may be a member of a certain</span><i>breed</i><span style='font-style:normal'>. Within StarLogo areprimitives of the form </span><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>ask-&lt;breed&gt;&lt;list-to-run&gt;</span> that specify that a block of code is to be done onlyby turtles of that breed. This lets you easily specify that half of your trucksare &#8220;left&#8221; trucks and move to the left, while the other half ofyour trucks are &#8220;right&#8221; trucks and only move the right. This breedtechnique is further expanded in Video Game StarLogo to encapsulate the breedand include its own shapes, sounds, and code. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>StarLogo is a procedural language like Logo. Video GameStarLogo, however, is object-oriented, which allows the programmer to moreeasily distinguish between separate resources intended for different breeds andother elements of the world. Thus, the programming style is more similar toMIMD  (multiple instruction, multiple data) programming, since each object hasits own code and runs it independently from the others. </p><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022556"></a><aname="_Toc386022623"></a><a name="_Toc386188513"></a><a name="_Toc387909848"></a><aname="_Toc387913340"></a><a name="_Toc388971394">5.4<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Implementation</a></h2><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022557"></a><aname="_Toc386022624"></a><a name="_Toc386188514"></a><a name="_Toc387909849"></a><aname="_Toc387913341"></a><a name="_Toc388971395">5.4.1<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Bongo: Logo for Java</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>The current version of the video game construction kit isimplemented in Bongo, a new language created for kids to bring the simplicityof Logo programming to Java. Bongo, written by the author and Brian Silverman,is a dynamic, statically-scoped, object-oriented programming variant of Logothat is run by an interpreter written in Java, thus running on all platformsthat support Web browsing (For more information on Bongo, including languagedocumentation, tutorial, and sample projects, seehttp://www.media.mit.edu/~bongo). Bongo allows us to implement this video gamekit as a simple application in a high-level dynamic language that can easily bealtered at run-time. Since Bongo is interpreted, it is easy to try out newfeatures in the video game construction kit and update old copies withoutrecompilation. Bongo is also modular, which allows programmers to easily createdifferent microworlds in Java and link them dynamically into Bongo.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>The video game construction kit application includes aJava Bongo module, a Video Game StarLogo compiler written in Bongo, and a UIwritten in Bongo that uses an Intel Java Animation Library to speed up graphicoperations. The Java Bongo module implements the StarLogo virtual machine andexports control commands to Bongo as a set of new primitives. It manages theturtles, the turtle code, the patches and the graphics. The compiler is avariant of the Cricket Logo compiler which provides support for breeds andVideo Game StarLogo&#8217;s particular set of primitives. The UI is written inBongo and consists of the different editors described in section 5.2.</p><h2 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc388971396">5.5<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Space InvadersWalkthrough</a></h2><p class=MsoBodyText>This section walks through the creation of a SpaceInvaders game. It illustrates each aspect of the game design so that the readermight gain insight into the development process.</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc388971397">5.5.1<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Conception ofthe Game</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>We&#8217;re going to make a Space Invaders game. In thisclassic Atari 2600 game, we have a hero spaceship that the user controls. Thehero fires missiles at an incoming army of aliens who are marching back andforth across the screen. When the aliens hit the sides of the screen, they movedown a row, and head towards the other side of the screen. If the hero killsall the aliens, he wins. If the aliens ever touch down on the ground, the heroloses and the Earth is destroyed.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>There are two ways to begin programming this game withBongo. One is to go on the Web and use the video game construction kit viaNetscape. This version only lets the user save their game to the network. Theother option is to run the toolkit locally with a Java interpreter. Running itthis way removes any security violation problems the user might have whenaccessing the local file system. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Once the video game construction kit has been started, theuser sees three windows. One is the breed palette, where the user may create,modify and remove breeds from the game. The second is the blank playing field.The user can drag and drop breeds to this field to create characters for thegame. The third window is the command center. Here, the user can give VideoGame StarLogo commands to any characters that are on the playing field.</p><h3 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc388971398">5.5.2<spanstyle='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; </span>Breed Creation</a></h3><p class=MsoBodyText>First, we&#8217;ll assume that there are no libraries forSpace Invaders. Therefore, we&#8217;ll need to create three breeds: a hero,some aliens, and some bullets. We click on <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>Add Breed</span> in the breed palette and pop a breededitor dialog.

Again, we click on <spanstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>Add Breed</span> in the breedpalette and pop another breed editor. We name this breed <spanstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>aliens</span>, and go to theshapes palette to pick a good default shape for it. We drop this shape in itsshape container and continue. This breed doesn&#8217;t respond to user events,so this section of the code will remain blank. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Then we go to the <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>time-step</span> section. This section is for code thatwill run on every tick of the clock. We want this alien to move back and forthacross the screen and move down every time it hits a wall. Here is some codethat will do that:</p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifelse(xcor = left-edge) or (xcor = right-edge) </span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [setyycor - 2</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; rt 180</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fd 2]</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [fd1]</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoBodyText>This code says if the alien&#8217;s x-coordinate hasreached the left or the right edge, it should go down by two turtle steps, turnaround and take a few steps to get away from the wall. If it hasn&#8217;t hitthe edge, it should just move forward one turtle step across the screen. Thiscode assumes that the alien has been set up to face either side of the screen (<spanstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>heading </span>equals  90 or 270).</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Since we&#8217;ve got the hero and the aliens, we can testthem out before we create the bullets. We drag an alien from the breed paletteto the playing field to make an instance of it. Then we type <spanstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>ask-aliens [time-step]</span> inthe command center and watch it go. Whoops, we forgot to set up the alien sothat it points to the left or right. Double-clicking on it, we get a charactereditor. This looks very much like the breed editor, but it has a command centeron the bottom that only affects this character. In it we type <spanstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>rt 90</span>, to turn it sideways,facing to the right. We close up this editor and try running <spanstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>ask-aliens [time-step] </span>again.This time it works. Let&#8217;s now do <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>ask-aliens [repeat 100 [time-step]]</span>. The alienmoves across the screen, just like we wanted. When it hits the wall, it goesdown, and turns around to head in the other direction. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>If we have more than one alien, it will get tedious tokeep saying <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>rt 90</span> toset them up. We can open up the aliens breed editor again, and set the initialvalue of <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>heading</span> to90, so all new aliens will already point in the correct direction.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>Now, we can drag a hero onto the board and try it out. Thevideo game construction kit supports keyboard and button controllers. We clickon the <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>Left</span> button,and the hero moves to the left. Then we click on the <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>Right</span> button, and the hero moves to theright. If we click on the <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>Fire</span>button, we get an error, that we don&#8217;t know what the breed <spanstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>bullets</span> is. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>So, let&#8217;s make the <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>bullets</span> breed. We click on <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>Add Breed</span> and pop open another breed editor.Then we name it <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>bullets</span>.We go to the shapes palette and pick a default bullet shape for this breed anddrop it into the shapes container. This breed doesn&#8217;t respond to userevents, but it needs some <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>time-step</span>code:</p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <spanstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>if count-aliens-touching &gt; 0</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [killone-of-aliens-touching</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; explode</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; die]</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; fd1</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; ifycor = top-edge [die]</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoBodyText>This code says if the bullet touches any alien, then itshould kill it, explode, and die. Otherwise it should continue moving up thescreen by one turtle step and if it reaches the top of the screen, it shoulddie. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>We need to define that <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>explode</span> command. This should change the shape ofthe bullet to the explosion animation. (Animations are just containers formultiple shapes that either play through once, or cycle.) Well, going to theshapes palette, we drag out an explosion animation and drop it into the shapescontainer. Then in the auxiliary code section of the breed editor we do:</p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <spanstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>to explode</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; setshapeexplosion-animation</span></p><p class=MsoNormal style='line-height:normal'><span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; end</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText>&nbsp;</p><p class=MsoBodyText>This defines a new procedure named <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>explode</span> that sets the shape of the turtle tothe explosion animation.

First, we have to drag those practicecharacters to the trash. Then we drag out one hero for the game and place himin the center of the bottom edge of the window. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>Now we need a lot of aliens. But placing 30 or so aliensis a real pain. We can do it programmatically instead. Going to the commandcenter, we type in <span style='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>create-aliens36</span>. This creates 36 new aliens on the screen. Now, a neat mathematical wayto get them in a block involves their unique turtle number, or <spanstyle='font-size:10.0pt;font-family:Courier'>who</span>, and some division.

There were seven design criteria presented in ChapterFour that were expounded upon in detail. This thesis covered a range of topicsfrom game construction to the programming environment, and with each, attemptedto show what kinds of effects each option had on the overall system. Bongo doesimplement many of the recommendations made in Chapter Four.</p><p class=MsoBodyText><b>Understandability:</b><span style='font-weight:normal'>Understandabilit<i>y</i></span> was said to be linked to a constructionkit&#8217;s metaphors, language and tools. Bongo&#8217;s container-basedobject-orientation metaphor is key in achieving understandability. Theattributes of an object, such as the shapes, sounds, code, and state variables,reside inside that object, thus giving the user a sense of locality. Theprogramming language and the turtle metaphor is based on Logo, so thetechniques of body syntonicity are helpful to the programmer when trying toscript a character&#8217;s action. The direct manipulation interface alsoallows the children to manipulate each character, shape and breed in the systemas if its iconic representation were the real thing. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>One area where this video game construction kit might gofurther is to have better video game specific knowledge. In the example game ofthe last section, we had forgotten to include a way to end the game. Perhaps agame parser could look over the child&#8217;s shoulder while they are working,and suggest game features that should not be forgotten. More knowledge abouthow video games are constructed and played might bring some neededdomain-specificity to this general-purpose design tool.</p><p class=MsoBodyText><b>Uniformity and Elegance:</b><span style='font-weight:normal'> Bongo&#8217;s container-based object-orientation system provides alarge amount of uniformity to the construction kit. All objects are eithercontainers or primitive objects contained within other containers. Elegance ofprogramming comes from the StarLogo programming language. In its history,StarLogo has undergone several language transformations in an attempt to makeit less redundant and much more expressive. Video Game StarLogo inherits thiselegance from the latest version of StarLogo, which introduced the concept ofbreeds. Children can control and program breeds of turtles independently. Thecontainer system refines this further, allowing children to put code within thecontainer that it affects, and no longer have to specify the code&#8217;starget in the procedure body.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><b>Interactivity: </b><span style='font-weight:normal'>Thisconstruction environment also allows full interactive development of videogames. The direct manipulation drag and drop interface gives children anintuitive notion of how they can combine and construct their own compoundobjects and structures. Characters can be dragged to the playing field to addthem to the game. Objects can be opened up and inspected to see what kinds ofattribute objects live inside. At several times during development of theexample from Section 5.5, we were able to test out different characters to seeif the programmed behavior was correct. We had made several mistakes, but dueto the graphical nature of the environment, they were quite easy to find andfix. </span></p><p class=MsoBodyText> <b>Functionality: </b><span style='font-weight:normal'>Thevideo game construction kit achieves full functionality in the domain of videogame creation. Atari 2600 arcade-style games can be constructed easily andefficiently in this environment. However, input modalities are limited.Currently, Bongo supports keyboard and button inputs. However, joystick and mouseinputs would be desirable especially in the video game genre. Collaborativeconstruction and multi-player games are also not possible at this time.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><b>Transparency: </b><span style='font-weight:normal'>Thisconstruction kit is written in Bongo, a language very similar to Logo. Notcoincidentally, Bongo is quite similar to StarLogo, and thus to Video GameStarLogo. If children ever get curious about how the video game toolkit itselfis constructed, they may easily open up the source code and read it forthemselves. But Bongo is object-oriented, while Video Game StarLogo is onlyobject-oriented when augmented by the video game interface. This has theconsequence that children not familiar with object-orientation and/or Javaprogramming might become quite confused when trying to understand the low-levelimplementation. This is not necessarily a flaw in this toolkit, but can be usedas leverage. Since the Bongo language is very similar to Video Game StarLogo,the children can at least read the code without learning a new syntax, eventhough they might not fully understand its content.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><b>Powerful Ideas: </b><span style='font-weight:normal'>Videogames are in the kid culture and will remain in a central position for a longtime to come. Therefore, creating a powerful construction tool for children tomake their own video games definitely gives them leverage through which toexplore domains and discover powerful ideas. Through programming the charactersof a video game, children encounter ideas about feedback, control, abstraction,hierarchy, debugging and much more. These skills are very helpful in exploringother domains in their fields of interest.</span></p><p class=MsoBodyText><b>Reflection and Audience: </b><span style='font-weight:normal'>The last goals of construction kit design are reflection and audience.Bongo&#8217;s video game construction kit allows children to interactively anditeratively design their video game. They may make mistakes; they might scraptheir grandiose plans to make the next Doom; but they can keep trying anddesigning until they have created their very own unique video game.Bongo&#8217;s Java support provides children with the opportunity to not justcreate these games, but to also publish them on the Web. This form ofpublishing and its ensuing feedback from a wide variety of sources enablechildren to reflect upon their work as proud parents, always tweaking andfixing little things until they move on to a new project.</span></p></div><span style='font-size:12.0pt;font-family:Times'><br clear=ALLstyle='page-break-before:always'></span><div class=Section7><h1 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc386022558"></a><aname="_Toc386022625"></a><a name="_Toc386188515"></a><a name="_Toc387909850"></a><aname="_Toc387913342"></a><a name="_Toc388971403">6.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Conclusion</a></h1><p class=MsoBodyText>This thesis has discussed many different designconsiderations of which authors of game construction kits for children shouldbe aware. The Bongo-based video game construction kit described in the previouschapter addresses many of those design issues, in an attempt to create a toolthat provides children with understandability, uniformity and elegance,interactivity, functionality, transparency, powerful ideas, and reflection andaudience.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>While the toolkit achieves these goals, there is muchpotential for further development. Much educational research has recently beenfocused on creating communities of learners and collaborative environments onthe Internet. The Bongo-based video game toolkit is net-friendly, but gamedevelopment takes place off-line. We would like Bongo to support collaborativenetwork-based projects, where children could work either synchronously orasynchronously with each other. </p><p class=MsoBodyText>The Epistemology and Learning Group at the MIT MediaLaboratory has been thinking about creating a new virtual world for kids,similar to MOOSE Crossing, but graphical instead of textual. Children will beable to create graphical autonomous objects which exhibit programmablebehavior. Children will also be able to work collaboratively on joint projects.For example, in one room, several children might built a checkers board out of64 square objects of alternating colors, and 24 circle objects of the differentcolors. Then two children could play checkers against each other. Another groupof kids could build robot objects that played tag as they ran around the roomsof the virtual world. This shared world approach would also work for buildingvideo games and other projects. Each room could have its own rules about objectbehaviors and support their own microworld. This room approach would alsoeasily enable sharing and playing of other people&#8217;s projects simplythrough navigation of the shared world. Similar to Robot Odyssey, a new childcould explore literally hundreds of rooms, each with its own interestingproject inside that was created by other kids.</p><p class=MsoBodyText>In conclusion, since design activities are such animportant part of a child&#8217;s education, it makes sense to create goodconstruction tools to support such activities. This Bongo-based video gameconstruction kit is one possible construction tool to open up another pathwayfor a child to explore.</p><h1 style='margin-left:0in;text-indent:0in'><a name="_Toc387909858"></a><aname="_Toc387913350"></a><a name="_Toc388971404">7.<span style='font:7.0pt "Times New Roman"'>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span>Bibliography</a></h1><p class=MsoEndnoteText style='line-height:10.0pt'>Abelson, H., diSessa, A.(1981). <i>Turtle Geometry: The Computer as a Medium for Exploring Mathematics.</i><spanstyle='font-style:normal'> Cambridge, MA: MIT Press.</span></p><p class=MsoEndnoteText style='line-height:10.0pt'>Begel, A.

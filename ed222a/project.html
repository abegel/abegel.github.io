<h2>Preliminary Project Plan</h2>

<h3>Introduction</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Students who learn how to program often develop and revise
conceptual models of computing several times during their introduction to computer
science. Perhaps one measure of students' success in this field is their flexibility in
creating new representations abstractions in the understanding of how a computer
functions. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Last term, I taught <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61a">CS61a</a>, the introductory computer
science course at Berkeley which is taught with Scheme. <a href="http://www-swiss.ai.mit.edu/scheme-home.html">Scheme</a> is an elegantly simple
dialect of Lisp which combines simple syntactic structures with untyped static semantics
and an easily defineable and understandable dynamic semantics. Students in this course
step through several styles of programming (functional, object-oriented, and logical) at
the same time as they explore different subtopics in the broad field of computer science
(natural language, AI, object-orientation, recursion, symbolic math, calculations on
infinities, programming language evaluators and computer art). </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The class taught after 61a is <a href="http://www-inst.eecs.berkeley.edu/~cs61b">CS61b</a>, a course about data structures
taught with Java. <a href="http://java.sun.com">Java</a>, as opposed to Scheme, is a
strongly-typed language, borrows heavily from C++ syntax, and has a generally well-defined
dynamic semantics which are more complex. 61b uses the object-oriented style to introduce
students to complex data structures,abstract data types, and general notions of efficiency
of algorithms.</p>

<h3>Goal</h3>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I think that creating and revising abstractions and conceptual
models of computing seems to be very important skill to have in order to be a successful
computer scientist. When faced with changing languages, subjects and abstraction layers in
the many classes during one's career in CS, it seems that one could get lost rather easily
without specific attention from the instructor on acquiring this skill. </p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My proposal is to observe and analyze several students whom I taught
in 61a last term, and see how they are coping/adjusting with 61b. There are fundamental
changes in program representation, syntactic and semantic that could affect their
understanding of new material. I want to see how techniques that were used last term in
helping students adjust to the myriad forms of Scheme help or hinder students adjusting to
Java. I would also like to see how much correlation there is between students who do well
in 61a and those that do well in 61b, and why. </p>

<h3>Experiment</h3>

<ol>
  <li> I need to identify four or five willing participants from my 61a class who are now
    taking 61b. I'd like to get some students with a wide range of abilities and proficiencies
    in 61a. I'd also like to pick some of the ones I was closer to in my class.</li>
  <li> I need to go over and familiarize myself with these students' understanding of 61a and
    how they did. I will then make hypotheses about how I think they will do in 61b based on
    my impressions during 61a and their performance. </li>
  <li> I want to quiz the students in order to measure a baseline for their current
    performance in 61b. I suspect much of the quiz will dwell on Java concepts and machine
    models, but some of it will try to reframe standard 61a questions in a Java framework and
    style to see how well 61a concepts were retained and whether or not they transfer to a new
    langauge and programming style.</li>
  <li> I want to interview the students and ask them how they are making the adjustment to
    Java and 61b; the difference in focus, the busy work, the syntax of Java, switching from
    procedural to object-oriented programming, how well they work in teams (whether they're in
    the same teams as they were in 61a), how they are performing (perceived and actual
    performance), how much their TA helps out vs. the lecturer, and probably more.</li>
  <li> I want to correlate these students' impressions with those of their TAs, to find out
    how they perceive the students' process of adjusting and whether or not there were any
    obvious difficulties faced by 61a students. </li>
  <li> I'd like to do a follow-up survey toward the end of 61b to see how the students
    impressions of 61b and programming have changed. I'd like them to reflect upon 61b and
    their own performance, and then think on a larger scale about how 61a and 61b fit in
    together. I'd also like them to speculate on their future performance in upcoming classes
    and how techniques and conceptual models learned in 61a and 61b will help.</li>
</ol>

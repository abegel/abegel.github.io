 <h1>Analysis</h1> 
 <p><ul>
<li><h2>Students have trouble with recursion
</h2>
<ul>
<li>In Scheme, they use recursion because there is no alternative.
<li>In Java, they&#146;d rather use while loops and for loops. 
<ul>
<li>Iterative loops are more concrete about their limits. 
<li>Easy to look at and understand how the loop works.
</ul><li>Since iterative loops are equivalent to tail recursion, tail recursive procedures are easy to write in Java.
<ul>
<li>Most ended up writing reverse accidentally when they tried to write append.
</ul><li>Unfortunately, they don&#146;t switch to recursion when the simple solution demands it.
<ul>
<li>In Scheme, they used recursion to define append, but in Java they had to hack up a kludgy solution using iterative loops.</ul></ul></ul></p>

      <P>Try to direct the boat with and against the current. Experiment with 
      different settings for the current velocity and the boat's own speed. 
      <UL>
        <LI>With the current: Observe that overall, the boat's speed depends on 
        the current velocity. 
        <LI>Against the stream: Can you make the boat stand still in the 
        current?&nbsp; Try to set the curent's velocity and&nbsp; the boat's 
        speed so that the river sweeps the boat down. </LI></UL>

      <P>The following&nbsp; is a simple way to enrich the project so that it 
      allows quantitative experiments.</P>
      <P>Have two piers on the river. You can draw them directly onto the 
      background or use two turtles to represent them. It is better if you know 
      the distance between the piers from the beginning, but you can always find 
      it later. Hint: use the turtle's ability for exact motion to draw the 
      piers at a particular distance from each other. </P>
      <P>Now, have a counter to measure the "time" - number of steps - the boat 
      travels from one point to another. Even if your students are not 
      experienced programmers, they can suggest various ways to create a counter 
      in a MicroWorlds project. Some of their ideas may strike you as very 
      original. For example, the following idea was suggested by a fourth-grade 
      girl:&nbsp; Have a second turtle who's heading will change by one degree 
      each time the boat takes a step.</P>
      <P>Discuss with your students how the same counter can be used to measure 
      the distance the boat has traveled (this is the way to find the distance 
      between the piers). </P>
      <P>Program a pier (a color or a turtle) to stop the boat or to turn it, 
      and to stop or reset your counter. </P>
      <P>You are now all set for an experiment! Have the students estimate the 
      time it takes the boat to travel from one pier to another and then check 
      their results experimentally. Are the results always identical?

      <P>This project is an interactive guide to the starlit sky. The sky is 
      divided into 88 interlocking areas known as constellations, whose 
      boundaries were defined by the International Astronomical Union in 1930. 
      Stars can be weighed and measured, and their brightness, color, and motion 
      all have meaning. The constellations are quite different; still, they are 
      really only figments of man's imagination - handy inventions to help map 
      out the sky. To extend the possibilities of experimenting with this 
      project, the stars has been made visible not only in the night sky, but in 
      the daytime sky, too. </P>

      <P>There are a number of project-related activities you can involve your 
      students in, depending on their age. </P>
      <P>When planning a night sky observation activity for your students, 
      simply print out as many copies of the star map as you need. Have the 
      students identify and mark every constellation on the map using the 
      computer. Suggest they plot on the map any additional objects they see 
      while observing the sky.</P>
      <P>If your students are not yet comfortable with the coordinates on the 
      globe, they can use the coordinates of the city nearest to your location 
      from the list provided on the <STRONG>Location</STRONG> page. Discuss the 
      idea of time zones in class. Suggest that the students use the longitude 
      information to try to calculate the time difference between your local 
      time and the Greenwich Mean Time (GMT). Then let them check if their 
      results correspond to the time zone your city is in.</P>
      <P>Use the project to observe the seasonal changes to the Sun's movement 
      across the sky in your area. Try to enter different times of the year and 
      observe where the Sun rises and sets in different seasons and if the 
      length of the day changes vastly or just slightly over a year. </P>
      <P>Experiment with various latitudes to see the difference in the apparent 
      motion of the celestial objects. </P>

        <TR>
          <TD>From either pole, only half the sky can ever be seen at any one 
            time; objects circle the celestial pole but do not rise or set (they 
            are circumpolar). </TD>
          <TD>At midlatitudes, one celestial hemisphere is visible in its 
            entirety over a year, plus a part of the other one. Only some 
            objects are circumpolar.</TD>
          <TD>At the equator, the whole celestial sphere can be seen in a 
            year; the celestial poles lie on the horizons to the north and 
            south, and all objects rise and set.</TD></TR></TBODY></TABLE>

      <P>Over the course of one year, the Sun passes in front of a band of 
      constellations along the ecliptic. Collectively known as the zodiac, they 
      form the only area in which the planets can be observed. Experiment with 
      different times of the year. Find out the names of the constellations over 
      which the Sun passes. Do the dates when the Sun is in each constellation 
      correspond to the dates conventionally attached to the astrological house 
      of the same name (look it up in an encyclopedia)?</P>
      <P>You may want to make the stars leave a trace when they move. On the 
      <STRONG>Sky</STRONG> page, type in the Command center:<STRONG><BR>talkto 
      get "sky "turtles pd</STRONG><BR>This will put down the pens of all the 
      turtles on the page.</P>
      <P>This project contains a lot of scientific information: excerpts from 
      star catalogs, a set of standard three-letter abbreviations for all the 
      constellations, an algorithm for calculating the Sun's celestial 
      coordinates, etc. This information may be of particular interest to 
      high-school students studying astronomy.</P>

      <P>Building this project involves a lot of sophisticated programming as 
      well as some advanced mathematics. One way to make the project easier is 
      to only create a "map-maker" which plots the stars on the sky depending on 
      the observer's coordinates on the globe. </P>
      <P>Please draw the students' attention to the fact that sky maps are 
      different from ordinary ones. When the north is at the top of the map, the 
      west on the sky map is to the right and the east - to the left. Why? Try 
      to imagine looking at the sky map on the screen of your monitor while 
      holding it over your head.</P>

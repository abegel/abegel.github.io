<h3>Abstract</h3>

This paper describes CrystalBoard, a transparent shared whiteboard. An
extension of the MASH MediaBoard, CrystalBoard allows authors to
present original source material to large audiences using IP
multicast. In addition, the author and all participants may annotate
and markup the presentation in real-time. This application is
effective for presentation formats that include a moderate amount of
whitespace, but further work will be necessary to show its
effectiveness on densely packed formats.<p>



<h3>Introduction</h3>

<img align = "right" src="crystalboard-small.gif">

CSCW tools allow people to use computers as an aid to present
information to a large distributed set of receivers. These tools are
often intended for specialized uses, however, and do not suit all
needs for all people. This paper concentrates on the whiteboard
tool and its deficiencies in the area of pre-made content presentation. <p>

A whiteboard is used to present and annotate state information
presented in a CSCW session. Participants may draw on a computer
representation of the board using the mouse as a pen. They may
draw in freehand or other modes like those found in popular
paint programs. In addition, most whiteboards accept textual input. <p>

These tools allow people to write and draw onto a publicly-accessible
shared workspace.  However, they are limited to annotation and
creation of content in real-time. When someone wants to present
precreated information, they must copy and paste it into the
whiteboard, losing some content in the process. The whiteboard can not
display the complexity of content that the specialized authoring
application could. Formatting information may be lost, such as
multiple fonts, line wrapping and text positioning. In addition,
copying mixed media content can be vexing if the whiteboard does not
support all of the media types used. <p>

CrystalBoard aims to fix the problem by keeping the content in the
application in which it was created. Presenters may show
material by simply dragging this transparent whiteboard over their
authoring application. All of the content will be transferred to the
receivers who are running an unmodified MASH MediaBoard.<p>

<h3>Related Work</h3>

CrystalBoard is an extension of the MASH MediaBoard, developed by
Teck-Lee Tung and Suchi Raman at UC Berkeley <a
href="#RT96">[RT96]</a>. The MediaBoard allows users to share data
using the Scalable Reliable Multicast (SRM) protocol <a
href="#FJLMZ95">[FJLMZ95]</a> over IP Multicast. The MediaBoard
itself is based on an earlier whiteboard created at LBNL <a
href="#M92">[M92]</a>. <p>

In addition to shared whiteboard, several OS vendors have been making
their presentation applications shareable. Sun sells the Showme suite
of tools, which includes a whiteboard with the ability to import
screen snapshots. They also have a shared application tool which
allows users to share any X application. The application's interface
is duplicated on each person's machine, though only one person can
interact with it at a time. Microsoft sells NetMeeting, a full video
conferencing suite which contains a whiteboard and the ability to
share applications. <p>

CrystalBoard also inherits characteristics from the Toolglass project
<a href="#BSPBD93">[BSPBD93]</a>. Researchers created see-through
interface elements that could filter and enhance the background
underneath. For instance, a fractal lens would fractalize any image it
was passed over. Robert Wilensky of UC Berkeley implemented a similar
sort of interface element for the Multi-Valent Document project <a
href = "#PW96">[PW96]</a>. Users can view documents in multiple views
and use transparent lenses to see superimposed information from
different layers.  <p>

<h3>Goals</h3>

There were several goals for this shared presentation tool:<p>

<ol>
  <li>It should allow the user to present material to any number of
       people.
  <li>Users should be able to present their unmodified original work
       from any application.
  <li>It should let all of the participants in a shared session to
       annotate and mark up the material.  
</ol><p>

The first goal is one of scalability. Simplistic sharing tools will
often use direct TCP connections between participants leading to a
<i>n squared</i> web of links. More sophisticated systems use
multicast to broadcast each data once to all listeners.<p>

Another key idea in this project was to allow users to share their
original source material with an audience. Shared application tools do
a good job of this, allowing presenters to
replicate their applications' windows on remote clients. For example,
a PowerPoint session may be replicated on the remote participants'
monitors for them to follow along. <p>

The last goal is to provide good tools for online markup and
annotation of presented material. There are many implementations of
shared whiteboards like the MASH MediaBoard. They often provide similar
tools to those found in popular drawing packages like Adobe
Illustrator or CorelDraw. <p>

These three goals have not yet been met in a single
application. Microsoft's and Sun's shared application tools allow
presenters to show original source material. MS NetMeeting even comes
with real-time annotation tools to allow participants to draw on
and mark up presented documents. However, both vendors' tools do not
support large numbers of participants in a session because they use
the point-to-point TCP/IP protocol.<p>

Whiteboard utilities like the MASH MediaBoard support all of the
real-time annotation requirements, but importation of source material
via cut-and-paste invariably changes the content and presentation
style. These types of utilities are more suited for on-line creation
of content.<p>


<h3>Design</h3>

It is possible to combine the good qualities of annotation with a
direct manipulation style of information presentation and meet the
three goals described above. <i>CrystalBoard</i> is a "network lens"
which rides on top of a display and transmits all information captured
visible through it across the network. In addition, it supports annotation
tools, such as freehand sketching and text input, to be displayed on a
translucent layer above the lens.<p>

<img align = "right" src="netscapeusage.gif">

The use of CrystalBoard is very simple. Presenters simply place
their CrystalBoard on top of any application window, such as Netscape,
and begin discussing their material with remote participants. When
they feel the need to emphasize a particular point, they can underline
words or draw circles around items that are visible through the
lens. If an audience member wished to make a point, he could also draw
on the lens through his client program, an unmodified MASH MediaBoard.
While the presenter needs a CrystalBoard to present her work, the
remote participants require only a normal whiteboard. The background
visible through the presenter's lens is transmitted as a picture for
the receivers' whiteboards to display with all annotations drawn
on top.<p>


CrystalBoard is a minimalist application consisting of an opaque
frame surrounding a transparent middle. There is only one mode of
operation. The user can click-drag to draw in freehand mode. She may
also type on the keyboard, sending text to the screen whereever the
mouse button was last released. There is one color, one font, and one
type of line. These features may be enhanced in the future. <p>

Whenever the user clicks on the frame or drags it around the screen,
the new viewable area is sent over the network to all remote
participants. Thus, if the presenter wishes to show a new page of work,
she may simply drag the frame around until the new page is shown
inside. <p>

Client users can use the MASH MediaBoard to view these
presentations. The MediaBoard receives background images from the
presenter over the network and displays the annotations and text on
top. Whenever a new background image comes in, the one that was
already displayed is replaced by the new one. Since the client is an unmodified
MediaBoard, the remote participants may annotate and draw on the
presentation which is multicast to everyone else, including the
presenter.<p>

<h3>Implementation</h3>

The CrystalBoard is implemented in X Windows under UNIX. It consists
of an add-on module to the MASH MediaBoard that replaces the Tk
drawing canvas with an InputOnly transparent X Window. This window
captures the user's events and translates them into MASH MediaBoard
commands which are then sent over the network to be displayed by
all participants. The commands are also echoed locally to CrystalBoard,
which draws them over the background of the screen.<p>

When the presenter wishes to send the image contained within the lens to
remote users, she clicks on the frame. This takes a snapshot of the
background visible through the frame and saves it as a GIF. It is then sent
over the network using the preexisting MediaBoard image protocols.
Likewise, when the user drags the frame to a new location on the
screen, the background in the new location is captured and sent over
the network. Then the X display in the former location of the
CrystalBoard is cleaned up and restored.<p>

<h3>Analysis</h3>

Is a shared, transparent whiteboard <i>useable</i>? Is it <i>useful?</i>
No user tests were conducted, but I had some feelings about the
system while it was being developed.<p>

<h4>Usability</h4>

<i>The whiteboard is useable, but only for simple presentations.</i> The UI
is invisible and modeless, which leads to easy everyday use. The mouse
only has two functions in the canvas, drawing and cursor
placement. The keyboard is used for typing whereever the cursor was
placed. Because of this, it is very easy to invoke simple features, but
hard to design in more complicated tools like those found in paint
programs and more sophisticated whiteboards.<p>

<i>How is the application's usability when applied to the task of
presentation?</i> The presenter may use any existing applications and
tools to prepare a presentation. Once the CrystalBoard is booted, the
mouse is only used for dragging the frame around the screen and
sending new backgrounds to the receivers.<p>

For a static presentation, this tool suffices. However, after moving
the CrystalBoard to a new location on the screen, the background is
updated, but the drawing layer on top is not scrolled and gets out of
sync with the background below. As such, it would be nice to reinvent
the CrystalBoard to be <i>more</i> than just a transparent whiteboard. The
CrystalBoard should be just a window on a full-screen transparent
whiteboard. This way, the CrystalBoard only defines the <i>current</i>
area of presentation and drawing. If the presentation moves to a
different portion of the screen, the window may be moved and leave the
drawing behind in the old spot. The background that would now be sent to all
recipients could be added to their MediaBoards in the correct
relative position as it is displayed on the author's screen.<p>

<i>How does CrystalBoard fare with non-static presentations?</i> If the
content shown underneath the CrystalBoard changes asynchronously (due
to an animated GIF or movie), it is questionable whether the
background should be updated on a more frequent basis. Barring the
implementation details of knowing when another window has drawn onto
the screen, should transfer of a new background be controlled solely
by the user clicking on the frame or should the background be sent
whenever any change to the screen underneath the CrystalBoard occurs?
Since the CrystalBoard is positioned solely as a static presentation
tool, it is not designed for sending high-frequency bitmap
updates. Other presentation tools are more suitable (video
conferencing applications or Timbuktu-style remote control applications)
and could be made more general to support this type of collaborative
work. <p>


<h4>Usefulness</h4>

<i>Is the CrystalBoard useful?</i> It can be surprisingly effective in
presentations using graphs, pictures or other formats that contain
large amounts of whitespace. It has also been tried in Netscape with
varying results. The more cluttered a page is, the more difficult it
is to add additional information by drawing or typing.<p>

Font type and color also have a big impact on the visibility and
discernability of annotations to documents. Originally, CrystalBoard
defaulted to a 9x15 non-proportional font and black color. Not
only was information difficult to see, but since the
majority of visual information in many programs uses black for text,
CrystalBoard text and drawing was difficult to separate from the
background. Consequently, the color was switched to hot pink and the
font type to 18 point Helvetica. This improved discernability
dramatically, but didn't help at all with the clutter. <p>

Authors spend a great deal of time on layout of non-mutable
presentations. When the opportunity arises to use CrystalBoard to
present the material, it quickly becomes apparent that smaller amounts
of whitespace offer less space for annotation. While it is easy to
circle and underline items to highlight them, without extra space, it
becomes hard to "write in the margins." Graphic presentations often
fare better than text presentations because authors leave more
whitespace around graphics for better layout. <p>


<h3>Future Work</h3>

In the future, there might be small improvements to the UI. Additional
UI features should include a resizable window, erase/undo,
user-selectable color and font, and a click-through mode. <p>

This last addition warrants further discussion. The authors of
Toolglass realized the importance of a click-through mode in their
magic lenses. They created click-through color-buttons that can change
the shade of the object below them. Supporting click-through in
CrystalBoard would allow the presenter access to the underlying
presentation tool. This way, the presenter could switch to the next
slide in PowerPoint, or scroll the window in Netscape without having
to move the CrystalBoard out of the way.<p>

Click-through, combined with the reinvention of CrystalBoard as a
window onto a larger transparent whiteboard, would make for a more
interesting and useful CrystalBoard. It would, however, force an
answer to the question of how to represent low-frequency image shifts
on the receivers' whiteboards.<p>

While there are quite a few ways to enhance CrystalBoard to
work with background animation, I feel that this simple application
would benefit most from additional UI elements. Any radical redesign
to support large presentations should be made to a new implementation.<p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>

In conclusion, the CrystalBoard is an effective tool for presentations
of original source material to a large audience. Its ability to allow
all participants to annotate and markup presentation content is due to
its inheritence of networking features from the MASH Media
Board. Thus, CrystalBoard meets all three of our design goals with a
very simple, easy-to-use user interface.

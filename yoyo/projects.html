<p>We have many different activities planned for YoYo. To date, we have
constructed versions of <a href = "http://www.media.mit.edu/~starlogo">
StarLogo</a>, 
<a href =
"http://fredm.www.media.mit.edu/people/fredm/projects/cricket/">
Cricket Logo</a> and a Video Game player. </p>

<p><b><font size =+1>StarLogo for YoYo</font></b></p>

<p>StarLogo is a programmable modeling environment for exploring the
behaviors of decentralized systems, such as bird flocks, traffic jams,
and ant colonies. It is designed especially for use by students.
It took about 3 days to make our first working version of StarLogo
by porting it from the Macintosh. This past summer, two MIT
undergraduates fleshed out the program and have turned it into an
easy to use, portable StarLogo. We're currently at work improving its
performance and putting the finishing touches on it. Look for its
release in a few months.</p>

<p><b><font size =+1>Cricket Logo for YoYo</font></b></p>

<p>The Cricket is a tiny computer, powered by a 9 volt battery, that
can control two motors and receive information from two sensors.
Crickets are equipped with an infrared communication system that
allows them to communicate with each other. Crickets are programmed in
a dialect of the Logo programming language, a procedural language that
includes constructs like if, repeat, and loop, global and local
variables, 8-bit numeric operations (addition, subtraction,
multiplication, division, comparison), motor and sensor primitives,
timing functions, a tone-playing function, and a random number
function.</p>

<p>We ported Cricket Logo from <a href =
"http://www.lcsi.ca">LCSI's</a> MicroWorlds Logo
to YoYo. (It wasn't hard, YoYo is simply a variant of Logo.) We have
a copy available <a href = "download/cricket.zip">here</a> for the PC,
but it won't do much good unless you have a Cricket. Crickets are
currently only available to E&L sponsors and research
collaborators. <a href = "download/cricket-1.1.zip">Here's</a> 
a version for Java 1.1 (if you've got either 
<a href = "http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/">Sun's JDK 1.1.x</a>
or <a href = "http://java.sun.com/products/jdk/1.1/jre/">JRE 1.1.x)</a>.</p>

<p><b><font size=+1>Video Games</font></b></p>

<P>For his <a href =
"http://www.media.mit.edu/~abegel/begel-meng-thesis.pdf">master's
thesis</a>, <a href = "http://www.media.mit.edu/~abegel"> Andrew
Begel</a> developed a YoYo-based video-game construction kit.  The
kit integrates YoYo with a pre-release version of <A
HREF="http://developer.intel.com/ial/jmedia/">Intel Animation for
Java</A>, <A HREF="http://www.intel.com">Intel</A> Corporation's new
Java animation package. The kit has been used to create
versions of classic video games such as Space Invaders, 
Pacman, and Frogger.</p>

<p> The goal is to create an online community of young game
designers. Kids will put their YoYo-based games on the Web, where
other kids will be able to play the games, provide feedback and
suggestions, or even modify and extend the games.</P>

<p>Unfortunately, Intel cancelled their IAJ project last year, so the
video game kit doesn't work anymore. Look for the kit's reincarnation
in the next few years.</P>

<h1>YoYo Tutorial</h1>		
<i>Created 1/27/97 -- Modified 12/9/98</i>
<hr>

YoYo is a programming language built on top of Java. YoYo is
descended from Logo. It is object oriented and
integrates well within the Java language framework.
<p>
This document is intended to be an introduction to YoYo from the
ground up. It will introduce the syntax, semantics and basic elements
of YoYo, hopefully in a way that a person may "get up" on YoYo in
just a short time.
<p>

<hr>
<h2>Start</h2>

Well, since we have to begin somewhere, let's start by explaining what
you just downloaded. After you unpacked YoYo you got a yoyo.jar file,
several .yoyo files, and several .html files. There are also batch
files that let you easily run YoYo from the command line.  The YoYo
files are used by YoYo when running your YoYo code.  

<p> Before you begin to use the YoYo development environment, you need
to have a copy of Java. You can either use a supported browser, or go
to Sun's web site (<a href =
"http://java.sun.com">http://java.sun.com</a>) and download the JDK
1.1.x. You may also download the JRE 1.1.x if you do not need to
program in Java.<p>

To start the interactive interpreter, run the class
<code>yoyo.Toplevel</code> (methods will be differnet
depending on your particular Java platform. On Macs, there will be a
YoYo CommandCenter application. Double-click it. On PCs, you can
double-click the yoyo.html file to run the command center in IE 4.0,
or use the command-line java runner (java, jview, or jre, depending on
which Java you're using) to run the class yoyo.Toplevel). 

<p>This will bring up a text window with the interpreter in it.  Upon
startup, it says "Welcome to YoYo!" and blinks a prompt at you.

<p>Once YoYo has started, you may type a command in the text box and
press return to run it.
<p>
print 5 + 6<br>
11<br>
<p>
If you say print 5 + 6, YoYo computes 11 and prints it to the
interpreter and says ok.  Print is a command that takes one input and
prints the value in the interpreter window.  + is an infix operator
that takes in two numbers and returns the addition of them.
<p>
If you ever want to execute print 5 + 6 again, you don't need to
retype it. Just move the cursor to anywhere on that line and press
return. YoYo will run that line again.
<p>

<hr>
<h2>Intro to Math</h2>

YoYo supports lots of different math functions with order of operations. 
Let's try some now:
<p>
print 5 + 6<br>
11<br>
<p>
Notice the dot that flashes quickly at the end of the 6? That dot
tells you that YoYo is computing something. It goes away when you're
allowed to type again. If you hit a key while YoYo is computing, it
will cancel the operation.

<p>print 5 - 6<br>
-1<br>
<p>
print 5 * 6<br>
30<br>
<p>
Notice that there is a space between every word in YoYo. This is important.
<p>
print 6 / 5<br>
1.2<br>
<p>
Also notice that YoYo supports real numbers as well as integers. In
fact, all numbers are real (regardless of how they print out) unless
it is necessary to coerce them to integers for some internal
calculation.
<p>
print 6 mod 5<br>
1<br>

print 6 / 5 + 3<br>
4.2<br>
<p>
print 6 + 5 / 3<br>
7.6666<br>
<p>
So far, you've only seen infix math operators. YoYo also has prefix
operators which act like functions.
<p>
print min 5 6<br>
5<br>
<p>
print random 6<br>
3<br>
<p>
print random 6<br>
5<br>
<p>
Random is a function that takes a number and generates a random
integer between 0 and the number. (0 <= random < x)
<p>
print random 5 + 7<br>
9<br>

<p>
When a prefix function takes an argument, you may supply the result of
another function.  5 + 7 returns 12 to random, which takes this and
uses it make a new random number between 0 and 12.
<p>
If you're unsure about how YoYo is reading your prefix and infix
calculations, you may put parentheses around each part to force YoYo
to read things your way.
<p>
print (random 5 + 7) * 6<br>
18<br>
<br>
<p>
YoYo picked 3 to be a random number between 0 and 12 and then
multiplied it by 6 to get 18.
<p>
There are other math functions, which are listed in the reference manual.
<p>

<hr>
<h2>Intro to Lists</h2>

YoYo is a dialect of Logo, which is a dialect of Lisp. Its basic data
struction is a list. A list is a group of items that may contain
anything including other lists.  Lists are mutable and may be added to
in the front or on the back.
<p>
To make a list, do this:
<p>
print list "a" 6<br>
[a 6]<br>

<p>
We just made a list with two elements, the string "a", and the number
6. List is a function that takes two inputs and creates a list with
those two elements. You might notice that the quotes are gone when the
list was printed out. When strings are printed out, the quotes are left
off because only words can be strings.
<p>
Lists are also printed with two []'s at either end. You may type a
list in directly with these braces to avoid using a function like
list.
<p>
print [a 6]<br>
[a 6]<br>

<p>
print [a 6 4 [c d e 5] b]<br>
[a 6 4 [c d e 5] b]<br>

<p>
You might notice that it's also more convenient when you want to
create a list with many elements in it.
<p>
If you want to add elements to a list or join two lists there are
functions to do that.
<p>
print fput "a" [b c d]<br>
[a b c d]<br>

<p>
print lput "b" [z y x]<br>
[z y x b]<br>

<p>
print sentence [a b] [c d]<br>
[a b c d]<br>

<p>
print se "a" [c d]<br>
[a c d]<br>

<p>
<i>Se</i> is an abbreviation for sentence. Sentence takes two inputs, a
string or a list and joins them together. (like append in Lisp, except
sentence will listify any string into a list before joining them)
<p>
Lists also come with functions to get values out of them.
<p>
print first [a b c]<br>
a<br>

<p>
print last [a b c]<br>
c<br>

<p>
print item 2 [a b c]<br>
b<br>

<p>
First and Last are self-explanatory. Item takes in two inputs: an
index number and a list.  The indexth element of list is pulled out
and returned. (item counts from 1)
<p>
You may also do other operations on lists.
<p>
print length [a b c d e f [g h i]]<br>
7<br>

<p>
print list? [a b c d]<br>
true<br>

<p>
True and false are the booleans in YoYo. Only false is false,
everything else is true. (3 is true, 0 is true, "foo" is true, true is
true, not false is true; false is false, not 3 is false, not [] is
false, etc...)
<p>
print position "b" [a b c d]<br>
1<br>

<p>
print position "polly" [a b c d]<br>
false<br>

<p>
Position tells you the position of an element in the list. It starts
at index 0 of the list. If it does not find it, position returns
false.
<p>
Notice that all of these commands take an input list and return a new
list as output.  None of them mutate (change) the list. The only YoYo
list mutator is set-item (which can alter an element of a list).
<p>

<hr>
<h2>Intro to Variables</h2>

In YoYo, variables
do not have to be declared and can contain anything. There are no
static types in YoYo. (and no static type checking!)
<p>
To make a new variable do,
<p>
set foo list "a" 6<br>

<p>
Now we have a new variable called foo that contains the value [a 6].
<p>
print foo<br>
[a 6]<br>

<p>
We can refer to the value of foo by just using its name.
<p>
set bar list "b" 5<br>
<br>
set cow se foo bar<br>
<br>
print cow<br>
[a 6 b 5]<br>

<p>
Even though foo contains [a 6] now, you can change it to be anything later.
<p>
set foo 6<br>
<br>
print 5 * foo<br>
30<br>
<br>
set foo [polly wants a cracker]<br>
<br>
print item 3 foo<br>
a<br>
<br>

<p>
<hr>
<h2>Intro to Functions</h2>

YoYo also has procedures. There are two ways to define
procedures. The simple way is to create a new text file with any text
editor. In the file, type in <p> 

to my-new-function<br> 
print 5 + 6<br> 
set foo 3<br> 
print foo * 9<br> 
end <p> 

and then save it as test.yoyo. Go back to the YoYo interpreter and
type in <p> 

load "test"<br> 
 <p>

You don't need the add the .yoyo suffix. YoYo assumes it needs to attach it
for you.  Test.yoyo is loaded into the current interpreter and you
can now use your new function by typing its name.
<p>
my-new-function<br>
11<br>
27<br>

<p>

You can also create functions that take inputs. These inputs are
treated as local variables and may only be used within the function.
<p>
to my-next-function a b c<br>
print a * b<br>
print first c<br>
set a (first c) * a<br>
print a<br>
end
<p>

This is probably a good time to talk about commands and reporters. 
A command is a function that doesn't return any value (void for you C
people). Some examples are "print" and "set". A reporter is a function
or data value that returns a value. 6 is a reporter, as well as "list 1 2". 
<p>

Now continuing with our example:
<p>
load "test"<br>

<p>
my-next-function 5 6 [7]<br>
30<br>
7<br>
35<br>

<p>
print a<br>
a is not defined<br>

<p>
Procedures also may output values and become reporters.
<p>
to my-third-function a b c<br>
print a * b<br>
output 0 - b + a * a - first c<br>
end
<p>

set foo my-third-function 5 6 [7]<br>
30<br>
<br>
print foo<br>
12<br>

<p>
<hr>
<h2>Intro to Control Structures</h2>

There are several different ways to make your program data dependent. The first
is the if statement.
<p>
if 5 < 6 [print "math is king!"]<br>
math is king!<br>

<p>
if 5 = 8 [print "math is infallible"]<br>

<p>
If takes a boolean (or expression that evaluates to a boolean) and a
list. If the boolean is not false, it will run the list.
<p>
ifelse 6 < 7 [print "i smell."] [print "you smell."]<br>
i smell.<br>

<p>
Ifelse is a variant of if that can run either the consequent or
alternative if the predicate is true or false.
<p>
Repeat is another control structure that you may recognize from Turtle Logo.
<p>
repeat 5 [print "hello"]<br>
hello<br>
hello<br>
hello<br>
hello<br>
hello<br>

<p>
It takes a number and a list and runs the list n times. 
<p>
set i 0<br>
<br>
while [i < 5] [print i set i i + 1]<br>
0<br>
1<br>
2<br>
3<br>
4<br>

<p>
While takes two lists. The first is the predicate which is
checked at the beginning of every loop. The second is the list to run
when the predicate is true.
<p>
If you make a mistake:
<p>
set i 6<br>
while [i > 5] [print i set i i + 1]<br>
6 <br>
7<br>
8<br>
9<br>
10<br>
.<br>
.<br>
.<br>
<p>
and the program is not stopping, press any key and it will break.
<p>
56666<br>
56667<br>
<ctrl-c><br>
Cancelled!<br>

<h2>Intro to Objects</h2>

<i>Note: Objects are an advanced topic and not suited for beginner programmers.
YoYo's easier data structures are perfectly sufficent for kids in
elementary school. </i><p>

Since Java is an object oriented language, we felt that YoYo should
be one too.  Besides, it makes it easier to run Java code in your
YoYo programs.
<p>
Unlike Java, YoYo uses a prototype-based inheritance model. All
objects are instances. There are no classes. When you want to subclass
an object, find a good one laying around and copy it and then
customize the copy.
<p>
There are only a few built in object commands in YoYo, all the rest are
specific to a particular object. 
<p>
set foo new-object<br>
<br>
print foo<br>
&ltObject #45: Object&gt<br>

<p>
foo is now a new object with nothing in it. It has type "Object."
To add a field to foo,
<p>
set foo.a "bar"<br>
<br>
print foo.a<br>
bar<br>

<p>
We just added the "a" field to foo. The foo.a syntax is reminiscent of Java. 
Let's add some more.
<p>
set foo.b [a 5 3]<br>
<br>
set foo.c to-list [foo.a foo.b]<br>

<p>
foo.b is now set to the list [a 5 3]. foo.c is now set to the list
[bar [a 5 3]].  To-list is a procedure that takes an instruction list
and evaluates everything inside.  It then takes all the results and makes
them into a list. It's the functional analog to [foo.a foo.b] which
would interpret foo.a and foo.b as strings and not as variables.
<p>
Now, you might get the desire to have a copy of this foo object. 
<p>
set bar copy-object foo<br>
<br>
print bar<br>
&ltObject #46: Object&gt<br>

<p>
Now bar is a complete copy of foo. (copy-object copies the pointers to
the values inside, it doesn't copy the values.) 
<p>
We can then modify bar and foo will be untouched.
<p>
set bar.a [big man]<br>
<br>
print bar.a<br>
[big man]<br>
<br>
print foo.a<br>
bar<br>
 
<p>
You can consider copying an object to be the same as subclassing it.
Copies of objects come with a built-in field called <code>parent</code>.
<p>
print bar.parent<br>
&ltObject #45: Object&gt<br>
<br>
print foo.parent<br>
false<br>

<p>

Foo doesn't have a parent since it was a new object. 
<p>

This is the end of this simple introduction to YoYo. I'll be making
more documentation soon, but, until then, try to learn by reading
other pieces of YoYo code for inspiration. <p>

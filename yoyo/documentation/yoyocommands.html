<H1>YoYo Language Reference</H1>

This document is a reference manual for the YoYo language as of
version 3.0 (otherwise known as Simple YoYo). The language has been
simplified somewhat and should be a little easier to use, run faster,
and be more compatible with existing web browsers. <p>

The first section of this document will explain the different types
that YoYo knows about. The next section will describe the syntax of
the language (mainly, how it differs from traditional Logo). And, the
last section will describe the commands that are supported in YoYo.<p>

<H2>YoYo Types</H2>

YoYo is dynamically typed, meaning you don't have to declare types for
any variables you use. In fact, you never need to declare variables
before they are used. Just use them. <p>

There are several types of data that are dynamically checked by each
YoYo primitive upon entry. These are:<p>

<PRE>
&lt;number&gt; -- 2, 2.34, -56.67
&lt;symbol&gt; -- foo, bar, cow.moo
&lt;string&gt; -- "foo", "bar", "I had a little teapot"
&lt;boolean&gt; -- true, false
&lt;list&gt; -- [ foo, bar ]
&lt;object&gt; -- new-object
&lt;anything&gt;  -- any type
</PRE>

These type names will be used in the commands section to identify
which types are allowed by a particular primitive. <p>

<h2>YoYo Syntax</h2>

YoYo is very similar to Logo in its syntax, but different enough to
make me tell you what's going on. In YoYo, all things can be divided
into two categories, reporters and commands. Reporters -- primitives
like +, -, first, list, and data values like 6, "hello" and [a b c] --
return a value, where commands -- primitives like print, dotimes, if
-- do not. At the top level, everything you run in YoYo must be a
command or a sequence of commands.<p>

<pre>
print "hello"
repeat 6 [forward 10]
</pre>

Reporters may only be used as inputs to commands or other
reporters. <p>

YoYo has very little syntax. All commands or reporters should be
written with no punctuation (i.e. print, type, repeat, +, etc) and
separated by a space. Strings are denoted by double quotes at the
beginning and end of the string (i.e. "hello", "goodbye"). Numbers can
be specified in decimal (3, 3.4, -0.45, -.56) format, or hexadecimal
($AFE3, $6FFE). A list is denoted by a group of unevaluated reporters
inside a set of brackets (i.e. [ a b c ] is a list of three symbols:
a, b and c).<p>

A procedure may be written in two ways. The traditional Logo way uses
this syntax in a separate file:<p>

<pre>
to square
repeat 4 [forward 10 right 90]
end
</pre>

Here, we define a procedure named square that runs the command repeat
4 [forward 10 right 10]. Note that repeat takes two inputs, the
reporter 4, and the reporter list of 4 elements [forward 10 right
90]. Note that "to" and "end" must be on their own lines.<p>

<pre>
to square size
repeat 4 [forward size right 90]
end
</pre>

Here, we make a square procedure that takes in one input, the size of
the square to be made. Unlike Logo, you don't have to put dots (:)
before the parameter name, nor do you have to put dots in front of a
variable when you use it. A procedure can take as many inputs as will
fit on a line. <p>

You can also define a procedure using lambda, which is a more
Scheme-like primitive. A lambda can be thought of as a function object
that can be treated as a value, invoked as a function, passed to a
procedure as an input, or returned from a procedure. <p>

<pre>
set square lambda [size] [repeat 4 [forward size right 90]]
</pre>

Here, we have defined the square command using set. Set is how you say
"Make" in YoYo. Unlike make, however, you don't need to quote your
input to set. It is a special form. To continue, we set square to the
value of the reporter lambda. Lambda is a reporter that takes two
input lists, a parameter list (naming the inputs to the procedure
being defined) and a body list (containing a sequence of
commands). <p>

You may notice that YoYo evaluates all values when written down on the
command line or used as a reporter. Well, since a procedure is usually
a thing to run, and not a thing to use as data, there is a special way
to make YoYo treat it as data. Using the dots (:) operator, we can
delay evaluation of an object and just pass it around.<p>

<pre>
to map func list
ifelse empty? list 
  [output []]
  [output sentence func first list 
                   map :func butfirst list]
end

to cube x
output x * x * x   ; output x^3
end

to go
dolist [elt map :cube [1 2 3 4]] 
       [print elt]
end
</pre>

This example is a little more complicated. The map function applies a
function to each of the elements of a list and returns the resulting
list. Note, when we recursively call map on the fourth line, we put a
dots operater before the function in order to pass it as a value, and
not evaluate it on the spot.<p>

Note, that map and cube both use "output" to return a value to the
caller of a function. This is how you can make a procedure that is a
reporter. If you call output from your code, it will return a value
(make sure that all paths through the procedure all output a value or
you'll get a bug). <p>

Also, if you look in the cube function, we've written a comment after
the output x * x * x. A comment-to-end-of-line can be written starting
with a semi-colon (;). You may also write any comments outside of any
procedure definition in a YoYo file.<p>

The go function puts everything together. We use dolist to iterate
over the elements of the result of mapping cube over the list [1 2 3
4]. On each iteration, we print out the results of running cube. Here
is the result:<p>

<pre>
1
8
27
64
</pre><p>

We can also define temporary variables using let. Let's scope is the
entire procedure:<p>

<pre>
to foo
let [[a 6]]
print a
end

foo
6
</pre><p>

Let's syntax is similar to that used in another language called
Scheme. The let body is surrounded by a set of []'s. For each variable
defined in the let, another set of brackets is used. For example, we
might define several variables at a time:<p>

<pre>
to bar
let [[a 6] [b 7]]
print a * b
end

bar
42
</pre><p>

A let variable overrides any other of the same name defined above the
let. <p>

<pre>
set a 6

print a
6

to moo a
print a 
let [[a 7]]
print a
end

moo 2
2
7

print a
6
</pre><p>

Inside moo, a initially has the value of 2, the input argument. But
once the let happens, the new a has the value 7. This new a shadows
the first a to the end of the procedure. However, all this only takes
place in the procedure. None of the modifications to a have any effect
on the global variable a.<p>

That's it for syntax. As I told you, there really isn't much to
learn.<p>

<H2>YoYo Primitives</H2>

This section describes each YoYo primitive by category. There are
several categories: control flow, procedures and variables,
reflection, objects, miscellaneous, system, lists, math, and files.
This list is complete, but not entirely useful. There will soon be
documentation on what each command does and what kinds of arguments
and return values each has.
